# Playing the National Game: Minor League Baseball,  Cultural Production, and Representation

## Introduction

<p>This section of the dissertation returns full circle to questions of labor and power. Elsewhere, this dissertation takes up those questions by looking labor structures and practices directly shaping U.S. professional baseball’s working conditions. But, U.S. professional baseball’s labor practices are fundamentally connected with issues of ideology and representation. As Nathanson, Butterworth, and Nathan argue, U.S. professional baseball’s dominant cultural narratives often obscure or misrepresent the sport’s complex history and reality.<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup> This dissertation grapples with those complex realities by focusing on Minor League Baseball—an aspect of U.S. professional baseball often marginalized or overlooked. In presenting a labor history of Minor League Baseball and undertaking an analysis of Minor League Baseball and globalization, this dissertation emphasizes the complex structures that shape Minor League labor, arguing the labor victories achieved through collective action have largely failed to significantly improve working conditions for the majority of U.S. professional baseball players.</p>
<p>This section of the dissertation explores the intersection of player agency and cultural representation. It does so by addressing out three aspects of that intersection. First, it looks at how cultural representation systems often frame Minor League Baseball as representing a rural, agrarian idyll, addressing those narratives are complicated by the actual contours of U.S. professional baseball as played at the Major and Minor League levels. Second, it looks at how Major and Minor League teams use digital media platforms as a form of cultural representation. By doing so, it points out how these digital representation mechanisms most often work to reinforce dominant narratives. Third, it looks at how Minor League players use those same structures to push back on dominant representations and exert agency by presenting alternate perspectives on Minor League working conditions. </p>
<p>By doing so, this section of the dissertation highlights the severe limitations of dominant understandings and representations of Minor League Baseball. Previous sections of the dissertation have shown those limitations through taking up a labor history of Minor League Baseball and analyzing globalized labor practices. This section of the dissertation looks at the cultural representation structures and practices that also work to reinforce those dominant narratives, and highlights how the same structures and mechanisms can work to present alternate perspectives and experiences.</p>

## The Magical (Imagined) Minor League Baseball

<p>Popular culture representations of U.S. professional baseball have a long history of situating the game in a quasi-rural imagined space. The previous section of the dissertation pointed out how fixating on a curated version of U.S. professional baseball’s desegregation limits attention to other complex structures of race and racialization. Similarly, reinforcing a rural, agrarian idyll for U.S. professional baseball limits attention to the sport’s complex labor history and international presence. That rural idyll manifests in several dominant narratives about U.S. professional baseball’s cultural significance. For example, the long-standing debate about U.S. baseball’s origin story persists despite significant historical evidence which places early U.S. baseball in northeastern metropolitan centers like New York and Boston. Even so, the narrative that the game of baseball in the U.S. was originally played in the rural New York village of Cooperstown persists. That imagined origin story led to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum being built in the village of Cooperstown, which had no significant role in early U.S. baseball history. Cooperstown is frequently cited as a bucket-list destination for baseball fans and carries significant cultural weight as a site where U.S. professional baseball’s history and cultural significance are communicated to a broad range of audiences.</p>
<p>Similarly, popular baseball films since the 1980s have also reinforced that rural idyll. The idyllic, nostalgic representations of the national pastime communicated in these films revitalized perception and branding of American baseball (especially Minor League teams) which, through a strategic ideological connection with rural spaces, came to represent a “pure” form of the national pastime, promoting conventional values of family, tradition, and community. Film studies scholar Jim Collins describes films during this period as epitomizing “a ‘new sincerity’…obsessed with recovering some sort of missing harmony, where everything works in unison.”<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> According to Collins, these ‘new sincerity’ films “purposely evade the media-saturated terrain of the present in pursuit of an almost forgotten authenticity…fixing this recoverable purity in an impossible past…in which the problems of the present are symbolically resolved in a past that not only did not, but could not exist.”<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup></p>
<p>Such baseball films range from films based on novels (<i>The Natural</i> and <i>Field of Dreams</i>) to sweeping historical biopics (<i>The Babe, Eight Men Out,</i> and <i>Cobb</i>). Plot lines for a number of other films, including <i>The Bad News Bears</i> or <i>The Sandlot,</i> reinforce the connections between baseball, boyhood, and small-town Americana. These films also feature themes of traveling, road trips, or other types of physical or metaphorical journeys. Across the films, a distance or separation from urban spaces (and the racial/ethnic heterogeneity, poverty, and criminality stereotypically linked with urban spaces) further reinforces the “rural” as an ideal space for baseball. With the exception of <i>Bull Durham</i> (which carries its own problematic sexual politics), all of these films are told from the perspective of a white male character.<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> Heteronormative and patriarchal relationships abound, as do conservative Judeo-Christian values—albeit with varying degrees of explicitness. Even films like <i>Bull Durham, Bad News Bears,</i> or later <i>The Pitcher and the Pin-Up</i> that pushed against those sexual boundaries with plot lines, themes, or characters that could be progressive, end up supporting a dominant masculine narrative. </p>
<p>Although characters with non-white racial or ethnic identities do appear in some of these films, their marginal status is reinforced by caricatured representations. In <i>Bull Durham</i>, the character of Jose, a Latino baseball player, speaks only in broken English and is a superstitious but devout Catholic. Later baseball films like including <i>42</i> and <i>Million Dollar Arm</i> also provide limited agency for non-white characters, reinforcing white savior tropes or colonial power structures. The films that come out during these decades also feature an uptick in historical films from the pre-desegregation era, reinforcing whiteness as the norm in idealized baseball history. Describing baseball’s cultural connotations, Tudor talks about how popular culture representations of baseball are often designed to “transport spectators back to their childhood years, before the loss of innocence that accompanies adolescence. ‘Pure’ spectators will watch ‘pure’ baseball. Disturbingly, this purity has been linked to race.”<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> From <i>The Babe</i> to <i>The Natural,</i> to <i>Cobb, Eight Men Out,</i> and <i>A League of Their Own,</i> these films collectively reinforce a narrow vision of what baseball history should be remembered and who is allowed to participate in the “official” version of baseball history. Although Ken Burns’ 1994 <i>Baseball</i> documentary does include an episode on black baseball and the Negro Leagues, that history doesn’t get equal treatment or recognition in Hollywood cinema. As Pellom McDaniels points out, “African American male athletes…are regarded as heroic…become lionized examples of manhood, dignity, and nobility. Yet the big screen lacks fair and appropriate representations of African American male athletes as well-rounded, multidimensional men.”<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sport films as a genre have been critiqued for their glorification of white American masculinity, but films about baseball are particularly glaring, “highlighting the sports’ nostalgic significance…the transfixing and mythologized essence of what a simple, hard-working, family-minded, clean-cut All-American boy could achieve.”<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup> Literary critic and critical theorist Fredric Jameson used the term “nostalgia films” to describe historical films in which “the desperate attempt to appropriate a missing past is now refracted through the iron law of fashion change and the emergent ideology of the generation.”<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> Building on Jameson, George Lipsitz points out that realness or complete accuracy may not even be desirable for commercial film, which “generally do not claim to present historical truth. Even when films are set in the past, artists and audiences understand that the function of the movies it to entertain.”<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> He goes a step further, describing how audiences give film-makers “permission to tell fanciful lies” but also “insist that they make those lies moderately credible.”<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup>  According to Lipsitz, audiences “require ‘true’ lies, depictions of the past and present that are comprehensible to us and that locate our own private stories within a larger collective narrative.”<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup></p> 
<p>Based on W.P. Kinsella’s 1982 novel Shoeless Joe, Universal Pictures’ 1989 film <i>Field of Dreams</i> according to Ron Briley was a safe haven for a beleaguered Reagan-era middle class, using the baseball diamond as “a metaphor for reconciliation…reaffirm[ing] the domestic security of an earlier, more innocent America.”<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> Ray Kinsella’s (played by Kevin Costner) opening monologue from the film provides a compelling example of how these films craft strategic messages about baseball’s history and cultural significance. The film’s plot is built around the restoration of Ray Kinsella’s relationship with his deceased father. In this opening monologue, Kinsella’s words communicate a version of his family history in which is father was broken or permanently marred by both time spent in urban industrial factory work and the corruption of urban baseball in the form of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal. Noticeably absent in the opening monologue (and the rest of the film) is the widespread devastating impact of the 1980s farm crisis that impacted rural communities across the Midwest, including towns like Dyersville. Instead, redemption comes through the younger Kinsella’s return to the rural, agrarian life. Placing baseball in that space is the key to helping Kinsella restore his relationship with his father. </p>
<p>As much as <i>Field of Dreams</i> is about baseball, it’s also about the ideological power of the rural as a space removed from urban corruption and steeped in rhetorics of purity and conservatism, a version of the rural or Midwestern that appears elsewhere in novels like <i>The Great Gatsby.</i> The crowded city spaces featured in the opening monologue with still images and later in the film with Kinsella’s travels contrast sharply with the wide open spaces of Iowa farmland. The sweeping landscape shots of Iowa farmland are also depicted aurally by James Horner’s Copland-esque Americana soundtrack that is eerily similar to the “American sound” in Copland’s <i>Appalachian Spring</i> and <i>Our Town.</i><sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> What has made <i>Field of Dreams</i> a classic, if not the classic baseball film, is how it links baseball with an imagined vision of rural agrarian American life that is described as a panacea to urban ills. A vision that has more to do with the “American-ness” of particular race, class, and gender intersections than spatial geographies.</p>
<p>The other iconic <i>Field of Dreams</i> scene, Terrence Mann’s (played by James Earl Jones) “People Will Come” speech, communicates similar themes. Jim Collins describes this scene as connecting “America of the late teens and the late 1960s…both periods are collapsed into mere passing moments alongside the eternal game that represents an eternal childhood.”<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> The staging of Mann’s speech against the backdrop (and interjecting) protestations of Kinsella’s banker brother-in-law highlights the film’s reductive class politics. White collar work—and by extension the more developed cities and metropolitan spaces they are associated with—are seen as antithetical to the rural agrarian vision, and the physical staging of the scene highlights these tensions. The scene begins with Kinsella, his brother-in-law Mark (played by Timothy Busfield), and Mann all sitting on the first base bleachers. As the scene unfolds and Mann’s speech drowns out Mark’s objections, Mann moves from the bleachers to stand in front of the field and players, while Mark remains on the bleachers, and Kinsella’s gaze shifts between Mann, Mark, and the field. The camera shots in the scene focus on either Mann delivering the speech, Mark interrupting to threaten mortgage and foreclosure, or Kinsella looking torn between Mann and Mark. The scene never frames Mann and Mark together, further illustrating the tension and distance between the redemptive rural imaginary and more pressing “real world” concerns.<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup></p>
<p>Mann’s speech also casts a vision of baseball history that ignores the American pastime’s repeated (and sometimes violent) marginalization and exclusion of identities that fall outside a white masculine norm. As Tudor describes, “Baseball becomes a gateway to innocence, transcendence and an uncomplicated social and personal past for the spectators. The social past evoked by this field refers to a time of national innocence apparently associated with the early part of the Twentieth Century…Pre-scandal baseball recalls the image of unregulated white major league sport, unregulated because everyone is honest and good.”<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> The return to the rural becomes inevitable and imminently desirable, reinforcing the ideological power and sway of baseball in this imagined space, applying the dominant ideology of Manifest Destiny and American Exceptionalism to baseball. The reductive history Mann’s speech outlines also highlights the nostalgia and memory politics at work in baseball films from this era. With the frontier conquered through franchise relocation and expansion and urban cities now corrupt, baseball reigns triumphant through a return to the imagined rural, reflecting broader neo-conservative ideologies.<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup></p>
<p>From the 1988 romantic comedy <i>Bull Durham</i> to the classic 1989 drama <i>Field of Dreams,</i> the films voted most popular by U.S. professional baseball fans reinforce the notion that the ideal version of the “national pastime” is played in rural, agrarian spaces.<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup> Those representations also tend to reinforce white masculinity as the norm within U.S. professional baseball—for players and for fans. Alternate representations that more accurately reflect the actual state of U.S. professional baseball labor fail to garner the same level of popularity and visibility as baseball films that reinforce white masculinity and a rural idyll.<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup> Under the guise of celebrating the “national pastime,” popular baseball films avoid grappling with the complex multi-racial and multi-cultural realities of U.S. professional baseball’s past and present.</p>
<p>The myth of the imagined (white) rural baseball idyll is just that—a myth. But its persistence demonstrates the power of dominant ideology in despite a wealth of complicating and contradicting evidence.<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup> According to David Leonard, films like <i>Field of Dreams</i> retain popularity through their “ability to codify ideologies of whiteness, masculinity, and nostalgia” and their “deployment of conservative ideologies under the guise of emotional story telling.”<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup> The popularity of narratives presented in such films manifest in other representational spheres, such as the baseball tourism industry in which baseball fans visit ideologically-significant sites that may not have actual historical importance.<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup> </p>
<p>Rather than grapple with the limitations of these dominant narratives, U.S. professional baseball largely reinforces them. For example, Major League Baseball actively mobilizes <i>Field of Dreams’</i> popularity and embedded nostalgia, as evidenced by a 2015 YouTube video in which Major League players of a variety of ethnicities and nationalities deliver the film’s iconic “People Will Come” speech.<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup> In a similar vein, a 2013 MLB Network promotional video took place at the <i>Field of Dreams</i> movie site.<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">1245</a></sup> According to the 2013 video’s narrator, the game of baseball has a “special place…place built by tradition and lit by the warm glow of memory.” As the video sequence unfolds, players emerge from the outfield corn and begin to play on the field. The narrator explicitly mentions the nostalgia at work, stating “Every generation has their chance to rewrite the mythology. To add the present to our pastime.” According to the narrator, baseball in this rural space is “as pure as the smile on a face and as powerful as history in the making.”  “If you build it, they will come” is no longer just a line in an iconic Kevin Costner film. It’s an apt description of how U.S. professional baseball continues to operate as homogenized white masculine space. And those dominant narratives actively influence how Minor League Baseball is represented to a broader public audience.</p> 

## Dominant Narratives and Digital Representation

<p>As previously mentioned, Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) emerged in the early twenty-first century as an attempt to strategically position U.S. professional baseball at the forefront of emerging digital markets and potential revenue streams. On one hand, MLBAM’s efforts have increased U.S. professional baseball’s visibility and made information about Major and Minor League teams more readily available. Minor League teams now have their own websites, which feature game updates, player profiles, and other types of publicity content. Those websites are often accompanied by Minor League team presence on a variety of social media outlets, most often including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Sport media scholars like David Sutera often argue that social media platforms increase fan engagement by giving fans greater access to “behind-the-scenes” information about their favorite players and teams.<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup> While that remains true, this subsection of the dissertation focuses on the ways in which the social media (specifically Twitter) content produced by U.S. professional baseball actually limits access to alternate perspectives that challenge dominant narratives. As a micro-blogging platform, Twitter is well-suited to communicating discrete pieces of content about players and teams. But that focus on the achievements and experiences of specific players, teams, and seasons limits attention to the large-scale structures and labor practices that are an equally significant part of U.S. professional baseball. </p>
<p>The Twitter accounts harvested in this include the verified team accounts for all Major and Minor League teams, as well as other available verified accounts affiliated with U.S. professional baseball. A full table of the accounts harvested is provided in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/appendices/H">Appendix H</a>. While Twitter is merely one of the social media platforms used by U.S. professional teams, the challenge of harvesting reliable back-end data for Instagram or Facebook made Twitter a feasible choice for consistent data collection. The Twitter data presented in this section was gathered between March 2018 and November 2018 and represents 1,284,982 unique Tweets. The information gathered from Twitter works as both a dataset and an archive. It illustrates the “official” messages U.S. professional baseball communicates using digital platforms, while also illustrating how U.S. professional baseball uses Twitter as a platform to increase fan engagement and public visibility. </p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Twitter grew quickly in popularity before a 2013 IPO valued at $1 billion.<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup> While MLB Advanced Media began in 2000, no Major or Minor League teams joined the new social media platform until June 2006, when a single Minor League team joined the platform. While some branding initiatives like standardized official websites were top-down directives, Minor League Baseball’s limited national visibility allows teams some flexibility and autonomy in crafting their digital identity. Six other Minor League teams followed suit in 2008. MLB Advanced Media joined the platform in December 2008, followed by the first Major League team (Los Angeles Angels) in May 2009. The Colorado Rockies were the final Major League team to join the platform, creating their official account in June 2010. This timeline for Twitter adoption provides further evidence that new practices or trends originate in Minor League Baseball before being implemented at the Major League level.</p>
<p>Given their national profile, Major League teams have the highest number of followers; the 30 most-followed Twitter accounts are those of the 30 Major League teams <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Table 3)</a>.<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup>  Outside those top spots, the next most-followed teams are at the AAA level, in which teams are most often located in metropolitan markets like Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans. However, Liga Mexicana de Béisbol, the group of AAA teams that are not affiliated with Major League teams, has follower totals equal to the AAA teams affiliated with Major League teams. To put these numbers in perspective, the Twitter accounts for less-advanced Minor League teams tend to have fewer 5,000 followers, while AAA teams like the Memphis Redbirds and Nashville Sounds have anywhere from 55,000 to 70,000 followers. As a point of comparison, the least-followed Major League Twitter account (belonging to the Florida Marlins) has over 530,000 followers.</p>
<p>Comparing the number of Twitter followers across different Major and Minor League classification levels supports the larger argument made in this dissertation about the lack of public attention and wide-spread awareness for Minor League Baseball. While social media marketing and promotion efforts have increased access for geographically-disparate fans, comparing the number of followers for Major and Minor League teams suggests that the fans that engage with Major League Twitter accounts do not follow affiliated Minor League teams in equal numbers.</p>
<p>The Twitter content produced by official team accounts less than surprising, as game updates, team performances, and upcoming promotions dominate the Twitter content generated by teams during the 2018 season <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 68).</a> However, the circulation of these Tweets and the overall large following for team-run Twitter accounts makes clear the degree to which social media platforms like Twitter are an important mechanism used by U.S. professional baseball to communicate messages about its significance with a broader public audience. Those representations largely avoid wading into complex conversations or potentially ideologically-fraught topics. Team-generated Twitter content promotes a celebratory, optimistic vision of the game as it’s being played by Major and Minor League teams and players.</p> 
<p>However, the digital platforms used by U.S. professional baseball teams have recently moved toward initiatives that recognize the sport’s increasingly global dimensions. For example, Major League Baseball’s primary website (mlb.com) is available in Spanish, Japanese, and Korean, as well as English. Those multi-lingual options have been available at least February 2007, according to the Internet Archive’s WayBack machine.<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup> As another example, in 2018, Minor League Baseball launched Copa de la Diversión, a promotional campaign designed to increase Minor League Baseball’s engagement with Latinx communities. According to Minor League Baseball’s website, “’Copa de la Diversión,’ or ‘Fun Cup,’ is a season-long event series specifically designed to embrace the culture and values that resonate most with participating teams' local U.S. Hispanic/Latino communities.”<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup> According to the webpage for Copa 2019, “Copa serves as the cornerstone of MiLB's expanding Latinx fan engagement initiative to engage, entertain and delight the largest, youngest and most financially influential community in the U.S. today.”<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup></p> 
<p>On the surface, these shifts attempt to recognize and celebrate U.S. professional baseball’s relationship with global fan communities. An event like Copa celebrating Latin American culture creates space for alternate types of cultural representations. However, even public descriptions for Copa emphasize U.S. professional baseball’s interest in using multi-cultural fan engagement to secure additional revenue streams. More pointedly, “the largest, youngest, and most financially influential community in the U.S. today” does not constitute a significant effort to challenge existing dominant narratives about U.S. professional baseball. Nor does it offer a direct acknowledgement of the exploitative Minor League labor practices that increasingly impact Latinx players. Instead, Latinx communities are valuable to U.S. professional baseball only to the degree that they represent or offer affordable labor sources and new fan revenue streams.</p>

## Complicating Dominant Narratives

<p>Narratives that reinforce U.S. professional baseball’s white masculine ideal and connection with rural, agrarian geographic spaces become increasingly untenable when faced with the developments taking place in those purportedly rural spaces, as well as the developments taking place in U.S. professional baseball. Increased globalization and corporatization within agriculture as well as shifting geographies of production have drastically reshaped purportedly rural, agrarian cultural spaces.<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup> Additionally, conflating Minor League Baseball and rural geographic spaces ignores the Minor Leagues’ shifting geography. The Minor League affiliate system originally conceived by Branch Rickey focused explicitly on maximizing potential return on investment in player development initiatives. That mindset created vast Minor League operations coordinated by the Major League team. During the 1980s and 1990s, attitudes toward Minor League teams’ financial viability shifted. Rather than solely being about player development, Minor League teams also began to prioritize financial sustainability. Thus, Minor League teams shifted toward being strategically located in cities and regional markets that might be able to support a professional sport team. As <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figures 69 and 70</a> illustrate, Minor League baseball is played throughout the United States (and even outside the United States in Mexico), making it hardly exclusive to the rural, agrarian regions. The smallest community to host a Minor League team in the 2018 season (Burlington, Iowa) recorded a population of 26,700 in the most-recent U.S. census, questioning the degree to which Minor League teams are located in truly rural spaces.</p>
<p>The globalization of U.S. professional baseball has radically reshaped Minor League teams, even those playing in quasi-rural spaces like eastern Iowa. With increased numbers of players born outside the U.S., the degree to which the “national pastime” reflects a white agrarian idyll bears further scrutiny. First, as outlined in the previous section of the dissertation, U.S. professional baseball has not shied away from establishing Minor League teams and player development operations outside the U.S. Second, U.S. professional baseball also includes increasing numbers of players born outside Northern America, specifically players from Latin America and the Caribbean. Dominant cultural narratives or representations that place Minor League Baseball in quasi-rural spaces are at odds with the reality of where teams are actually located. Additionally, representations or narratives that reinforce white U.S.-born players as the norm are increasingly at odds with the sport’s global labor force.</p>
<p>Focusing on Minor League Baseball and its labor force frames U.S. professional baseball as a dynamic, contested borderland site. Looking at the global dimensions of U.S. professional baseball’s labor force further emphasizes how dominant cultural representations often fail to accurately reflect that nuance and complexity. Instead, many of these representations reinforce U.S. professional baseball as a sport played by white, U.S.-born men, for other white, U.S.-born men. The power of ideology allows these dominant narratives to persist. However, players and fans have increasingly begun to use digital platforms to communicate alternate perspectives and interpretations of U.S. professional baseball’s cultural significance.</p>
<p>As one example, in 2015, actor and comedian Chris Rock appeared on HBO’s *Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel* and presented an entire seven-minute segment on the limited presence and visibility of African Americans in baseball.<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup> Rock describes U.S. professional baseball as “old fashioned and stuck in the past…Baseball wants everything to stay the way things used to be.” Rock points out how U.S. professional baseball’s reliance on “tradition” is rife with racial politics—“there’s a right way to play the game. The white way. The way it was played 100 years ago, when only whites were allowed to play.” Rock isn’t alone in pointing out the whiteness of U.S. professional baseball’s traditions and codes of conduct. He mentions the backlash Cuban born Yasiel Puig experienced for his playing style after he joined U.S. professional baseball. Dominican Major League outfielder José Bautista faced similar criticism for the playing style he exhibited during a 2014 game. In a *Player’s Tribune* piece titled, “Are You Flipping Kidding Me?,” Bautista describes his actions as an emotional response to a significant moment, saying, “I didn’t plan it… It wasn’t because I don’t respect the unwritten rules of the game. I was caught up in the emotion of the moment.”<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> Bautista also points out how U.S. professional baseball’s unwritten rules—like those that govern the degree to which players can celebrate during a game—are invoked far more often for Latinx players. “Nowadays, when a player flips his bat, especially a guy who wears his emotions on his sleeve, a small section of people always seem to turn it into a debate about the integrity of the game.” Like Rock, Bautista argues many of U.S. professional baseball’s traditions and unwritten rules are in fact culturally-specific and not universal across global baseball.</p>
<p>Major League outfielder Bryce Harper made a similar argument in a 2016 *ESPN The Magazine* profile. “Sorry, Not Sorry,” made waves for critiquing U.S. professional baseball’s inflexible adherence to a narrow vision of appropriate conduct.<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup> According to Harper, “Baseball’s tired…It's a tired sport, because you can't express yourself. You can't do what people in other sports do.” For Harper, increasing U.S. professional baseball’s popularity with new generations of audiences requires taking inspiration from the types of spectacle and celebration on display in other U.S. professional sports and in baseball as played outside the U.S. *The New York Times Magazine’s* Jay Caspian Kang offered similar arguments in his 2016 article, “The Unbearable Whiteness of Baseball.”<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup> Kang admits that while U.S. professional baseball is financially stable, its “cultural relevance has been in a steady decline.”<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup> In a telling indictment, Kang emphasizes how U.S. professional baseball’s marketing efforts have become increasingly separated from the actual, real-world dimensions of the game, an argument made repeatedly in this section of the dissertation.</p>
<p>Kang critiques owners and executives for white-washing U.S. professional baseball, but he also criticizes sport media’s role in perpetuating this imagined history. “The source of baseball’s diminished hold on our imaginations runs much deeper than social-media strategy. The problem lies in the demographics of baseball’s rosters, and the shameful way in which the majority of its media has failed to pay anything approaching adequate attention to the Latino players who have entered the game over the last two decades.”<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup> Some more recent media coverage has drawn attention to the shifting demographics of U.S. professional baseball labor, and more recent films like *Sugar* (2008) and *Ballplayer: Pelotero* (2011) grapple with the lived experiences of Minor League players and the significant barriers faced by players of color and players born outside Northern America. However, that increased attention has not yet substantively challenged the sport’s existing labor structures. As outlined elsewhere in the dissertation, lawsuits attempting to revise Minor League Baseball’s legal status have not been successful. In fact, lobbying efforts by Minor League Baseball’s executive office have succeeded in rewriting federal law to foreclose legal alternatives for Minor League player action.</p>

## Conclusion: Minor League Players and Digital Advocacy

<p>As previously mentioned, Minor League players have few legal avenues for labor action. However, the same digital media platforms used by U.S. professional baseball to reinforce dominant narratives have increasingly been used by Minor League players to raise awareness about their labor precarity and often less than desirable working conditions. In doing so, Minor League players are using digital platforms’ affordances to exercise agency, voice dissent, and advocate on behalf of their own interests. As a prime example of this phenomenon, Minor League Grinders is an Instagram account started by former Minor League player Blake McFarland <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 71)</a>. Publishing crowd-sourced submissions and content, the account provides an insider’s perspective on lived experiences of Minor League Baseball players.<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup> In doing so, the account offers perspectives on Minor League working conditions that otherwise might not be accessible to a broader public audience.</p>
<p>For example, the account highlights the often sparse and crowded living conditions players adopt to minimize housing expenses. For example, the Instagram post in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 72</a> illustrates a single room filled with mattresses used by Minor League players, and <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 73’s</a> post shows how a group of Minor League players converted a studio apartment into sleeping space for four players. The Instagram post in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 74</a> shows an inflatable pool flotation bed being used as a bed. Unfurnished or minimally-furnished apartments are the norm <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figures 75-78)</a>, and Minor League players bemoan the impact these living conditions have on their playing ability and physical health <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 79)</a>. This genre of social media content also highlights the often poorly-maintained facilities at Minor League stadiums. <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 80’s</a> Instagram post shows a player showering outside in the rain because the ballpark’s shower facilities were not operational, and the Instagram post in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 81</a> features a player sleeping in a makeshift locker erected in the ballpark’s shower facilities. <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figures 82-84</a> illustrate the creative measures players use to avoid contamination exposure, given the negative impact an illness or infection would have on their playing ability. While Minor League teams are required to have a trainer or medical assistant with some level of professional medical training, the nutrition and dietetics resources provided at the Major League level (as well as resources that Major League players can personally afford) are noticeably absent at the Minor League level. As illustrated in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figures 85-87</a>, team-provided meals are minimally appetizing and lack the nutrition required by elite professional athletes.</p>
<p>On the surface, much of this social media content is presented in a humorous fashion. However, it provides key insights into how Minor League players experience their precarious labor conditions and adapt in less-than-ideal working conditions. Whether dealing with living situations, sleeping arrangements, or food sources, Minor League players who do not have substantial personal wealth, family support, or other income sources face a range of challenges. While some players have those additional support mechanisms and resources, many do not. And, as previously mentioned, Minor League players born outside the U.S. face significant additional challenges beyond those shared across the Minor League player community. With salaries that are below a living wage and playing conditions that are not significantly regulated, Minor League players have a long history of using creative measures to adapt and function.<sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup> Social media advocacy efforts like the Minor League Grinders Instagram account use digital platforms to communicate those tactics in new ways to broader public audiences. From sleeping on travel buses to dealing with broken equipment, this genre of social media content directly speaks to Minor League players’ working conditions <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figures 88-102)</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the conversation around the Save America’s Pastime bills and class-action lawsuits *Miranda v. Selig* and *Senne v. MLB* lawsuits has drawn attention to the working conditions of Minor League players, some current and former players have used social media to directly draw attention to their working conditions. In the Tweet presented in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 103</a>, former Minor League player Colin Young says “Minor League Baseball bus rides have prepared for any type of travel length of snafu. I can handle just about anything. I’m just glad that 9 year career has something to show for it besides the massive debt when I retired. Cheers!”<sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup>  Some Minor League players are drawing attention to the discrepancy between their working conditions and those experienced in the player development systems of other U.S. professional sports. After a sports journalist Tweeted about the salaries earned by players in the National Basketball Association’s player development G-League, current Minor League player Austin Warner responded with the following Tweet: “Early connecting flights, long bus rides, dumpy stadiums. Welcome to Minor League Baseball. Except G-League select contracts are $125,000. Guess how much us MiLB-er’s make?” <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 104)</a>. These posts and similar messages <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 105)</a> represent new strategies for digital activism used by Minor League players to increase awareness and visibility for their working conditions.</p>
<p>As another example, current Minor League player Kaleb Earls received his W-2 earnings statement in the mail and posted the following Tweet in response: “I just received my W2 and I made a whopping $3,712.05 during the entire baseball season. I feel bad for the players who have a family and can't pursue their dreams because they can't afford to take care of their families. People wonder why players have to get a job in the off-season” <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 106)</a>.<sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup>  On a more humorous note, current Minor League player Jordan Minch Tweeted “I make more money a month driving for uber [sic] than I do during the season” <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">(see Figure 107)</a>.<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup> As mentioned previously, Major League salary levels have a required minimum established via collective bargaining. For players who reach free agency and sign with a Major League club, their ability to negotiate large multi-year contracts is made possible by the salary protections and free agency provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Lacking the same avenues for negotiating on the free market, Minor League players’ salary levels and other forms of benefits are all dictated by team management. The Instagram post in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 108</a> shows the $183.00 earned by a Minor League player during a single earning period, and <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section3">Figure 109’s</a> Instagram post shows the $14.00 daily per diem a Minor League player received for food and other expenses. As a point of reference, the per diem rate used by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes is approximately $50 per day.<sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup></p>
<p>This genre of social media content has yet to have a substantive impact on Minor League labor structures and working conditions. But, its emergence over the last few years follows a longer tradition of U.S. professional baseball players using their “insider’s perspective” to challenge dominant or mainstream perceptions of the “national pastime.” For example, Jim Bouton experienced significant backlash after publishing his irreverent *Ball Four* in 1970.<sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup> Jackie Robinson’s 1972 autobiography *I Never Had It Made* draws on Robinson’s playing career to provide an incisive reflection on the intersection of race, sport, and politics.<sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup> Former Minor League veteran Dirk Hayhurst’s *The Bullpen Gospels* series provides a sardonic, if at times humorous, perspective on life in the Minor Leagues. The shifting conversation around professional sport as a full-time occupation is reflected in the attitudes of Minor League players toward the value of their labor. As evidenced by the player development structures and practices used in the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League, elite professional sport organizations have a range of options and models to employ when building minor league or affiliated player development systems. That Major and Minor League Baseball persist in maintaining the current Minor League structure and system suggests concentrated, strategic action by players will be required to enact substantive structural change.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century digital media landscape, the labor represented by digital forms of cultural production constitutes a key strategy used by U.S. professional baseball to communicate specific, strategic messages about the institution’s cultural meaning and significance. This section of the dissertation looks at how the many of those dominant cultural narratives associated U.S. professional baseball tend to overlook the material realities, historical conditions, and structures of power that shape the experiences of the sport’s labor force. Additionally, this section of the dissertation demonstrates the ways in which Minor League players use social media channels to draw attention to issues of labor and equity that have been largely otherwise overlooked. In doing so, this section of the dissertation points out the expanded notion of labor, production, and representation that may be needed for Minor League players to effect change in their working conditions and labor structures. </p>
