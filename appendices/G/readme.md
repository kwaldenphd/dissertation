Some redundancies were kept in the data structure to facilitate faster queries and easier visualizations, specifically the birth_country field in the ‘Biographical’ table and the classification field in the ‘Transactional’ table. Additionally, given the significant number of players and birth countries represented, a decision was made to additionally code country locations by region to facilitate more meaningful macro-level analysis of location trends, specifically for player birthplaces. The United Nations’s “Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use,” Series M, No. 49, was used to organize countries into regions and groups according to the UN taxonomy.
