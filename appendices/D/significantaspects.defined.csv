Field,	Explanation,
Players,	Unique player identifiers need to be linked with their place of birth; date of birth (year); and the various MLB and MiLB teams the individual has played for. A restriction of the licensing agreement by which the dataset was procured replaces player names with unique identifying numbers. For this project the most significant aspects of the data are the place of birth and MLB/MiLB transactional records. Age could be a useful element to track and analyze in the future but is not a particularly significant aspect or relationship for this project.,
Team; League; and Classification,	Location is a significant factor for both Major and Minor League teams which are located within and outside the United States. While standard abbreviations are used for MLB teams Minor League team names are used in their full form since a standard list of abbreviations does not exist for MiLB teams. The relationship between team and location is significant as are Minor League team’s relationship to their (1) MLB parent organization; (2) other MiLB affiliates in the same MLB system; and (3) other MiLB  teams in the same level/league. Additionally teams within and across seasons are populated by specific players so team information needs to also be linked with the identifying information for players who played on a specific team at a particular point in time. One of the challenges in representing or structuring this relationship is the fact that the ‘team’ entity is not static and in some cases chances location; name; and classification over time while still remaining to some degree the same ‘team’ entity. For example the California Angels; Los Angeles Angels; and Anaheim Angels are distinct team names but all refer to the same Major League organization. Similarly the Memphis Chicks were renamed the Memphis Blues and then the Memphis Redbirds while still maintaining their team identity. Given the complexity of making those team references across time given the attribute and data naming changes analysis and visualization for this project will focus on classification levels as key vectors rather than attempting to track ‘team’ as a distinct entity across time. To help simplify the data structure and Major League affiliations I am using MLB’s own abbreviations to describe the thirty MLB teams. This nomenclature constitutes a standardized or controlled vocabulary within the professional baseball and baseball research communities.,
Location,	As mentioned previously significant locations data elements for this project include players’ place of birth and the locations for MLB and MiLB teams. In addition to the country; state; and city attributes; geocoding information is also needed to effectively map and visualize the spatial dimensions of the dataset. Location information refers to both player biographical information and team location information a connection not logically/reasonably accounted for in the original data form.,
