# The Shot Heard 'Round the World: Globalization and Minor League Baseball Labor

## Introduction

<p>This section of the dissertation examines how macro- and micro-level trends in Minor League Baseball relate to and complicate MLB-dominated narratives around U.S. professional baseball’s globalization. By synthesizing data related to player birthplaces, team locations, and player movement over time, this section takes up three primary areas of inquiry. First, it addresses how Minor League demographics and global dimensions have shifted over time. By doing so, it provides a richer understanding of how the Minor League labor structures outlined in the previous section have developed across time and space. Second, it examines how the Minor League career trajectories for players born outside the U.S. differ from those of their U.S.-born counterparts. Taking up this analysis of Minor League players’ career prospects clarifies how the labor precarity addressed at length in the previous section increasingly impacts players born outside the U.S. Third, it investigates how the intersection of Minor League Baseball and globalization relates to or complicates dominant narratives that focus on Major League Baseball. In doing so, it argues for the centrality of Minor League Baseball as a dynamic global site.</p>
<p>As previously argued, Minor League labor conditions are structured and regulated in ways that strategically disenfranchise Minor League players. The previous section made that argument by outlining Minor League Baseball’s labor history and the labor activism efforts that have had little impact on Minor League working conditions. That section’s conclusion emphasized the significant precarity and tangible hardship experienced by Minor League players.  Those players have few, if any, alternate paths via which they can achieve a Major League career due to Major League Baseball’s legally-sanctioned monopoly status.</p>
<p>Certainly, precarious labor conditions impact a wide range of Minor League players. A richer understanding of Minor League players origins and career trajectories provides greater insight into how different groups of Minor League players experience those precarious labor structures. Not considering Minor League labor provides only a partial understanding of how U.S. professional baseball has been impacted by globalized labor practices. This section of the dissertation addresses the relationship between U.S. professional baseball’s global reach and “national pastime” claims through a close examination of Minor League data. By taking up this analysis, this section of the dissertation argues that considering Minor League teams and players in conversations about U.S. professional baseball’s global scope and cultural significance is essential.</p>

## The Implications of Global Baseball Labor

<p>The previous section of the dissertation presented the Miranda v. Selig and Senne v. MLB class-action lawsuits as examples of Minor League players’ attempts to reshape their labor conditions. While unsuccessful legal measures, both cases presented a profoundly simple argument—that focusing on the exceptional in U.S. professional baseball limits attention to the ordinary. Both cases argued that the disproportionate attention given to Major League players and outstanding Minor League players minimizes the degree to which general audiences are aware of most players’ career trajectories and working conditions.</p>
<p>Minor League labor is not the only arena in which focusing on the exceptional or notable within U.S. professional baseball obscures other processes, structures, and forces at work. For example, while U.S. professional baseball makes many claims about its history to argue for national pastime status, one of the primary arguments is “the Jackie Robinson story”—the moment when progressive baseball magnate Branch Rickey found the first African American player with enough athletic talent and skill to play at the Major League level and signed Jackie Robinson to a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson stepped up to the plate in 1947 and struck a blow for racial equality, marking U.S. professional baseball as a progressive, meritocratic space in which all who earned the opportunity to play would be welcomed. In terms of U.S. professional baseball’s exceptional stories, few have greater significance than this one.</p>
<p>Critical baseball scholarship has addressed and explored the problematic historical inaccuracies and limited perspectives included in dominant narratives about U.S. professional baseball’s desegregation. As Nathanson points out, fixating on the Robinson story limits attention to the significant obstacles Robinson and other players of color faced across the Major and Minor Leagues, as the long process of desegregation unfolded.<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>  In discussing U.S. professional baseball’s desegregation and increasingly global labor force, Ruck points out how signing black players and players from outside the U.S. to Major and Minor League contracts put already marginalized groups in an economic system that treated players as property, offered minimal labor protections, and did not yet include things like free agency or collective bargaining that greatly benefited Major League players.<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>  Burgos’s discussion of U.S. professional baseball’s relationship with Latinx communities points out how the inclusion of Latinx stars and racialized politics of passing had blurred baseball’s color line long before Robinson joined the Dodgers.<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>  Focusing on desegregation as only operating on a black-white color line limits attention to the varying experiences of Latinx players.<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> As Burgos argues, a fixation on Robinson’s 1947 season overlooks or obscures a more complex history of race, ethnicity, and racialization.<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Complicating such dominant narratives illustrates how they are often not supported by historical fact and obscure the actual conditions of U.S. professional baseball labor. The larger framing of U.S. professional baseball operating as a meritocracy and reflecting democratic ideals overlooks deep inequities and unwarranted abuses that characterize U.S. professional baseball’s labor structures and practices. Centering Minor League Baseball in an analysis of those labor practices further complicates those dominant narratives. Doing so also provides additional evidence of those inequitable labor structures and practices.</p>

## The Shifting Geography of U.S. Professional Teams

<p>For over fifty years, Major League geography had remained relatively stable. But as illustrated in Figures 29 and 30, a combination of Major League franchise relocation and expansion over the second half of the twentieth century have changed U.S. professional baseball’s geography. These battles between Major and Minor League teams had historical precedent in the ways Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption allowed it to bar other Minor League and independent teams from vying for competing Major League status. But, these struggles also present Major and Minor League team locations as sites of spatial contestation. Figures 31 and 32 illustrate how the number and geographic distribution of Minor League teams also shifted, as Minor League teams increased in number and had to reckon with shifting Major League territorial claims. Major League relocation and expansion brought with it a series of territory struggles between Major and Minor League teams.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball’s growth into a truly national pastime took place most often through usurping Minor League teams’ territory. For example, in the 1960 *Portsmouth Baseball Corp v. Frick* lawsuit, a Minor League team filed a lawsuit against Ford Frick (Major League Baseball’s Commissioner), alleging breach of contract after Major League games were broadcast in the Minor League team’s territory.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>  The case was ultimately dismissed because the parties were unable to establish a common interpretation of the Player Development Contract, which articulates the resources, rights, and obligations shared when Minor League teams are affiliated with a Major League team. </p>
<p>In 1971, a Minor League team owner filed a lawsuit arguing they never received agreed-upon compensation after a Major League expansion club (the Seattle Mariners) moved into the Minor League team’s territory.<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>  The court found the Minor League owner had no grounds for further legal action. In 1993, a prospective ownership group attempted to buy the San Francisco Giants, with the stated intention of relocating the team to Tampa Bay, Florida. Major League Baseball’s executive office did not approve the move, and the case’s plaintiffs argued that action was an unlawful restraint of trade, civil conspiracy, and an antitrust violation.<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> The court dismissed the suit and did not issue a definitive ruling on the potential antitrust violation. Just a year later in 1994, an ownership group was poised to purchase an AA-level Minor League team, with the stated intention of moving the team to New Orleans, Louisiana. Minor League Baseball’s executive office approved the purchase, under the condition that no higher-ranking team had claim to the New Orleans territory.<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>  A higher-level Minor League team did claim the New Orleans territory, voiding the ownership group’s agreement with Minor League Baseball. The ownership group argued the voided agreement violated antitrust law, but the case was dismissed based on lack of legal grounds. A similar scenario unfolded in 1999, after sports promoters arranged for a Minor League team to relocate to their city. After the governing Minor League organization did not approve the move, the sale fell through.<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> The group of promoters claimed the action constituted an antitrust violation, but the court ruled in Minor League Baseball’s favor. </p>
<p>These legal battles emphasize the lasting power of Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption and legally-sanctioned monopoly. The lawsuits offer further evidence of the antitrust exemption’s persistence in the face of numerous legal challenges. Whether owners were wanting to purchase a team, relocate a team, or receive agreed-upon compensation, the antitrust exemption was interpreted and enforced in ways that preserved Major League Baseball’s power over Minor League Baseball. As argued in the previous section of the dissertation, who would be allowed to join the community of team owners and reap the attendant economic benefits was repeatedly decided by existing Major and Minor League owners. </p>
<p>The antitrust exemption was enforced in ways that pitted Minor League owners against Major League owners. At the same time, it also pitted Minor League owners against each other. The Minor League classification system created a hierarchy in which more-advanced Minor League teams could prey on less-advanced Minor League teams. Lawsuits like those filed by the New Orleans Pelicans in 1994 and Baseball at Trotwood in 1999 show how that hierarchy negatively impacted less-advanced Minor League teams. Those lawsuits also highlight how Minor League owners and Minor League Baseball’s executive office at times have exhibited many of the same behaviors that led Minor League teams to challenge Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption. Minor League owners in 1901 had sufficient common interests to band together and form a formal association (the NAPBL, now known as Minor League Baseball). However, in the second half of the twentieth century, U.S. professional baseball’s labor politics created friction within the Minor League owner community. That dynamic lessened the change that Minor League owners would be able to present a united front in their increasingly frequent battles with Major League owners.</p>
<p>As outlined in the previous section of the dissertation, Minor League Baseball’s hierarchical classification structure became increasingly standardized after World War II. While the general structure has remained largely unchanged, a few key developments from the post-War period directly impacted Minor League Baseball’s global reach. Founded in the 1920s, Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB, translated Mexican Baseball League) came under the auspices of Minor League Baseball in the 1950s and was promoted to AAA classification in 1967. As discussed in the previous section, the affiliated Minor League structure and the associated Player Development Contracts require all Minor League teams to have formal affiliations with a Major League team. In contrast, Liga Mexicana de Béisbol is officially part of Minor League Baseball but does not have formal affiliations with any Major League team. As a contrasting example of Minor League Baseball’s global presence, the Foreign Rookie League classification emerged in the late 1990s and by the 2000s was a standard part of Minor League Baseball’s classification system. Taken together, Liga Mexicana de Béisbol and the Foreign Rookie League classification are the primary mechanisms through which Minor League Baseball teams have established an increasingly global presence. </p>
<p>Incorporating Minor League data complicates a North American-centric view of U.S. professional baseball team locations.<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> As Figures 33 and 34 illustrate, since the 1960 season, U.S. professional baseball teams have been located in Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Japan, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> However, Figures 33 and 34 also illustrate how the teams located outside Northern America are exclusively Minor League teams. The 76 Major League teams located outside the U.S. have been in Canada, making Major League teams a distinctly North American phenomenon. In contrast, Minor League teams affiliated with the “national pastime” have existed in Latin America and the Caribbean, Australia, and Asia. Minor League teams’ global presence questions the degree to which U.S. professional baseball can accurately be described as a “national” pastime. Figure 35 illustrates how those global team locations have developed over time, and Figure 36 emphasizes the reality that Minor League teams constitute the growing number of teams located outside Northern America. </p>
<p>Figures 37 and 38 depict the spatial distribution of U.S. professional teams through the second half of the twentieth century. Those visualizations illustrate the overwhelming concentration of teams within Northern America, specifically within the U.S. Figure 38 compares the number of Major and Minor League teams located in each country, highlighting the degree to which the most-advanced U.S. professional teams—Major League teams—are located exclusively in North America. Figure 39 looks at the geographic distribution of Major and Minor League teams within the U.S., highlighting the total number of Major and Minor League teams located in each state. Given the limited number of Major League teams, many states have never been home to a Major League team. Some states like North Dakota, South Dakota, and New Mexico have fielded a small number of Minor League teams. In contrast, other states like New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas have a high concentration of both Major and Minor League teams. The number of teams resulting from the Minor League system’s growth has allowed states without significant Major League history or connection to support a Minor League team.</p>
<p>Parsing those trends across classification levels provides greater nuance for team locations’ shifting geographies. While the number of least-advanced Minor League teams grew during the 1970s, those teams were located primarily in the southeastern and Appalachian regions of the U.S. In contrast, the least-advanced Minor League teams that emerged in the 1990s were part of the newly-formed Foreign Rookie League classification. The significant globalization that has taken place in U.S. professional baseball over the last three decades has taken place largely at the Minor League level, and specifically at the least-advanced level of the Minor Leagues. Figure 40 illustrates those aggregate trends by decade. In the 1960s, Minor League teams were located solely in the U.S. and Canada. As the Foreign Rookie leagues emerged in the 1990s and Minor League Baseball attempted other types of global affiliation experiments, the number of Minor League teams located outside the U.S. increased. While the number of Minor League teams located outside the U.S. has increased, the total number of Minor League teams has also grown since the 1960 season (see Figure 40). As illustrated in Figure 40, the growing number of Minor League teams has increased U.S. professional baseball’s global presence, while also increasing the number of teams located in the U.S.</p>
<p>However, Figure 41 illustrates how the Minor League teams located outside the U.S. are almost exclusively at the least-advanced Minor League classification levels. Figure 42 represents that data as a spatial visualization, illustrating the overall density of Minor League teams, compared to the limited number of Major League teams. Additionally, Figure 42 emphasizes how the teams located outside North America represent the least-advanced Minor League classification levels. This data might seem to contradict Gilbert’s argument that Major League owners responded to free agency by capitalizing on new sources of players and fans. If U.S. professional baseball wanted to build new global fan markets, a better strategy might have included placing more-advanced teams in new global markets to more effectively build global fan interest. Instead, the strategy implemented by U.S. professional baseball drives global fan traffic and revenues back to existing Major League teams. By formalizing an international player development system, Major League Baseball is presented as the pinnacle of professional baseball achievement. Rather than global teams or leagues being the ultimate destination for elite players, Minor League Baseball’s global reach inserts the U.S. professional baseball hierarchy into countries and regions that often already have their own professional baseball organizations. Thus, global fans following their local players might eventually become fans of the U.S. professional team those players join, driving revenue back to Major League Baseball. </p>
<p>This analysis of Major and Minor League team locations makes clear the global scope of U.S. professional baseball. For example, Figure 43 shows how the number of U.S. professional teams located in Canada has increased since the 1960 season, including both Major and Minor League teams. Figure 44 shows the same change over time for Minor League teams located in Latin America and the Caribbean. While U.S. professional baseball might be described as the “national pastime,” the number of Minor League teams located outside the U.S. complicates any characterization of U.S. professional baseball as being uniquely or exclusively “American.”</p>
<p>To further examine those trends, Figure 45 illustrates how Major League teams have been located exclusively in Canada and the U.S. By comparison, Figure 46 shows how the increasing number of AAA-level teams driven by Major League expansion have been located almost exclusively in the U.S. and Canada. That trend continues at the AA and A levels (see Figures 47 and 48). The total number of Minor League teams increases, but those teams are located almost all located in the U.S. and Canada. Only at the least-advanced levels of the Minor League system (Rookie and Foreign-Rookie) does the increasing number of teams located outside the U.S. and Canada become clear (see Figure 49). Figure 49 provides another way of visualizing the reality the global reach of Minor League Baseball teams occurs only within its least-advanced classification levels.</p>
<p>In many dominant narratives, locating teams outside the U.S. provides opportunities for prospective players to access the financial, social, and cultural mobility a Major League career might offer. However, that framing misrepresents and obscures Major League Baseball’s complex history with global forms of organized baseball. As Ruck, Burgos, and others have outlined, U.S. professional baseball in the early twentieth century had no qualms about accepting players born outside the U.S.—provided those players were able to pass as white.<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>  Additionally, existing baseball scholarship has documented the thriving baseball cultures that have existed outside the U.S.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup></p>
<p>One way forward could have been partnerships or collaborations that supported professional baseball organizations outside the U.S. However, Major League Baseball’s approach to engaging other baseball organizations denied the legitimacy of those global organizations, or their ability to compete with Major League Baseball on the global market. For example, the Brooklyn Dodgers filed a lawsuit in 1946 charging two Mexican scouts with inducing players under contract with the Dodgers to break their contracts and sign with Mexican League teams.<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> The court ruled in Brooklyn’s favor. Looking to forestall similar legal actions, Major League Baseball enacted strict regulations prohibiting players currently under contract with a Major or Minor League team from playing in any capacity for an international professional team, even if doing so did not directly impact their ability to fulfill their Major or Minor League contractual obligations.<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> Players who sought better working conditions and increased compensation with organizations like the Mexican League found themselves subsequently blacklisted by U.S. professional baseball.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup></p> 
<p>However, when the opportunity emerged for Liga Mexicana de Béisbol to become formally affiliated with Minor League Baseball, U.S. professional baseball raised no objections to an arrangement that expanded global presence and opened new labor sources. In many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Foreign Rookie League teams established by Minor League Baseball displaced local professional and semi-professional teams, whose players saw greater potential for future profit through seeking opportunities in U.S. professional baseball. Even in countries and regions with thriving baseball operations, U.S. professional baseball has shown no qualms about asserting its own global presence via Minor League teams. Those measures position Major League Baseball as the highest (and most financially-lucrative) option for global professional baseball players.</p>
<p>Rather than approach globalization by partnering with existing international baseball organizations, U.S. professional baseball’s attitude toward other baseball organizations might best be interpreted as a unilateral global application of their domestic antitrust exemption. That exemption has allowed Major League Baseball to bar other teams and leagues in the U.S. from establishing themselves as true competitors. Major League Baseball displays the same attitude in its dealings with global baseball organizations—coexistence is possible to the degree it does not threaten Major League Baseball’s position in the global market. Other baseball governing bodies like the International Baseball Federation and Pan-American Baseball Confederation collaborate regularly and partner for events like the World Baseball Classic, the World Baseball Cup, and Olympic Games. In contrast, U.S. professional baseball has repeatedly restricted players’ ability to participate in the World Baseball Classic and other forms of international baseball competition.</p>
<p>U.S. professional baseball’s complex relationship with other baseball organizations is one of many tactics used to assert sovereignty over territory. These tactics are deployed in ways that avoid substantively collaborating with or acknowledging the sovereignty of other global baseball structures. The Minor Leagues’ Foreign Rookie classification represents another method used to assert U.S. professional baseball’s global presence. A third way in which U.S. professional baseball asserts its global presence is the development of the Latin American academy system. First established in the 1970s after the first wave of Dominican-born players had increasing Major League success, the academy system represents another method of spatial colonization U.S. professional baseball has developed to facilitate identifying and controlling additional labor sources.</p>
<p>Prospective professional baseball players born in the U.S. are governed a complex series of regulations that address amateur status, collegiate athletics, and professional contract eligibility. As Marcano and Fidler have pointed out, the academy system is explicitly designed to prey on underage talent.<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>  Indeed, in the Collective Bargaining Agreements and other governing documents, very little directly address the academy system. In contrast, U.S. professional baseball’s only stipulation when offering contracts to players born outside the U.S. is that the player be 18 years of age or turn 18 during the contract’s first year. Players who sign a Minor League contract benefit from some degree of Minor League-wide labor regulation. By comparison, no similar policies or documents govern the academy system, in which players under the age of eighteen routinely enter into formal agreements with U.S. professional teams.</p> 
<p>In the academy system, underage players live in facilities where there living and playing conditions have little, if any, regulation and organizational oversight. Marcano and Fidler make this point vividly, outlining the career endingly-poor medical treatment Alexis Quiroz received while playing for a Dominican summer league team.<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>  The most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement requires all Major and Minor League teams to make a certified medical trainer available to players. No such requirement exists for the academies, a fact mentioned repeatedly in media coverage of the 2011 death of Dominican prospect Yewri Guillén.<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>  While public calls for greater transparency and regulation followed these incidents, U.S. professional baseball did not take concrete action. Greater regulation of the academy system and international player recruitment are topics that could be addressed via collective bargaining. However, as with topics relating to Minor League labor, collective bargaining negotiations have not made the academy system or international player recruitment a substantive issue in negotiations.</p>
<p>The extent to which U.S. professional baseball has significantly invested in the Latin American academy system indicates U.S. professional baseball’s reliance on extractive colonial economic systems, as evidenced by a player development system that mines the Latin American and Caribbean global south for prospective professional baseball players. U.S. professional baseball has made significant investments in Latin American and Caribbean player recruitment and development systems. That regional focus contrasts sharply with their other global engagement strategies. In contrast, international signings for players not from Latin America go through a very different intake process. The small number of Australian professional players who have signed MLB contracts are signed as undrafted free agents, outside a brief attempt to establish a formal Minor League affiliation structure with Australian Baseball League teams.<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> The enduring outcome of that affiliation experiment is Major League Baseball’s Australia Academy Program, a seven-week player development program for Australian players who go on to be signed as undrafted free agents or play professional in the ABL.<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> The limited scope of the Australia Academy Program (founded in 2001), as well as similar MLB academy programs in Italy (established in 2005) and China (2007), stands in stark contrast to the extensive Latin American academy system, whose labor practices target underage workers and operate with minimal regulation or transparency.</p>
<p>In response to Major League Baseball’s decision to focus on Latin America and the Caribbean as sources of professional baseball labor, other professional baseball organizations outside the United States have explored alternative possibilities and avenues for their players to achieve competitive and commercial success. As an example, the Australian Baseball League and Baseball Australia partnered with the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) to add an Australia-based Korean team to the Australian League. Geelong-Korea debuted as part of the Australian Baseball League in the 2018 season, and through a partnership with MLB Advanced Media, MLB TV, ABL TV, and KBO, stream the team’s games for an international audience. According to Australian Minister for Sport, John Eren, the partnership between the two nation’s baseball organizations “will boost the profile of the game in Victoria, bring extra excitement into the competition, and act as a pathway for our talented baseballers to join overseas clubs.”<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup> The full ramifications of Major League Baseball’s global presence continue to unfold as conversations around international baseball partnerships like the Australia-Korea collaboration and the World Baseball Classic continue, and baseball is posed to return to the XXXII Olympic Summer Games in 2020. As those negotiations around global baseball organizational structures continue, U.S. professional baseball persists in relying on extractive labor practices in the Dominican academy system that targets underage workers and violates the sovereignty of existing foreign baseball organizations in ways that continue to reshape the contours of organized baseball outside the United States.</p>

## The Shifting Origins of U.S. Professional Baseball’s Labor Force

<p>Team locations represent one way in which globalization has reshaped U.S. professional baseball in the second half of the twentieth century. However, where Major and Minor League players are born also emphasizes the significant impact of globalization on U.S. professional baseball. After U.S. professional baseball became increasingly regulated and structured in the early twentieth century, Major and Minor League owners exercised a significant degree of control over players’ contracts, assignments, playing time, and compensation levels. The MLBPA’s labor activism in the 1960s and 1970s increased player agency, via labor victories that had a positive impact on Major League players’ working conditions. As Gilbert argues, owners responded to those shifting power dynamics by reimaging their approach to player development and identifying additional sources for inexpensive player labor.<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup> Globalization of Minor League team locations are one manifestation of that effort. An increasingly global labor pool is also directly connected to Major and Minor League owners’ attempts to secure new, inexpensive sources of player labor. As Ruck and others have argued, U.S. professional baseball’s attitude toward player development has a long history of colonizing available player labor, with little if any regard for other organized baseball structures.<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> The spatial dimensions of those processes include team locations, but they are shaped directly by how players move organizational structures and across national boundaries.</p>
<p>To provide a sense of overall perspective, nearly 30% of the players who have played U.S. professional baseball between the 1960 and 2016 were born outside Northern America. Further analyzing that 30% figure emphasizes how the globalization of player birthplaces has occurred largely over the last twenty years. Looking at both Major and Minor League players, Figure 50 illustrates that, while most players are born in Northern America, a significant number of players are born in Latin America and the Caribbean. By comparison, the number of players born in Europe, Africa, Oceania, and Asia is relatively low. Still, the data presented in Figure 50 emphasize the truly global dimensions of U.S. professional baseball labor. To more fully understand the globalization of player labor, Figure 50 breaks down the number of Major and Minor League players born in specific global regions. Looking just at Major League players, over 8,000 have been born in Northern America, compared to over 1,500 in Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast, only 87 Major League players have been born in Asia, 45 in Europe, and 31 in Oceania.<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup>  Even when just considering 10% of the total labor pool, U.S. professional baseball labor is undeniably global in scope. Figure 50 also illustrates the total number of Minor League players born in these global regions. As expected, Northern America and then Latin America and the Caribbean have the highest number of players born in those regions, with 34,830 Minor League players born Northern America and 13,713 in Latin America and the Caribbean. By comparison, 31 Minor League players have been born in in Africa, 378 in Asia, 221 in Europe, and 293 in Oceania. As demonstrated by data, global representation in U.S. professional baseball labor has moved beyond mere tokenism. A substantive number of players are born outside Northern America, representing a truly global labor pool.</p>
<p>Figure 51 begins to parse those trends over time, focusing on players born in Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America. Of Major League players who played in the 1960 season, 44 were born in Latin America and the Caribbean and 522 were born in Northern America. In the 2016 season, 327 Major League players were born in Latin America and the Caribbean and 987 were born in Northern America. To make that comparison using Minor League data, in the 1960 season, 158 Minor League players were born in Latin America and the Caribbean, compared to 1,495 born in Northern America. In the 2016 season, 2,988 Minor League players were born in Latin America and the Caribbean, compared to 4,177 born in Northern America. </p>
<p>The total number of Minor League players born in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased significantly over the last twenty years (see Figure 52). However, the number of Major League players born in that region has not increased at a proportional rate (see Figure 52). Similarly, a very small number of Major League players come from regions like Africa, Oceania, Europe, and Asia (see Figure 53), despite the increasing presence of players from those regions at the Minor League level (see Figure 54). Figure 52 provides further detail of how those numbers shifted over time, using ten-year intervals to compare the number of Major and Minor League players born in Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America. The trends presented in Figure 52 show increasing numbers of Minor League players born in Northern America—an expected trend. However, the visualization also makes clear how the most dramatic increase in global representation has occurred at the Minor League level.</p>
<p>Looking at the Major and Minor League divide over time emphasizes the increasing overall number of players, as well as the increasing ratio of players born outside Northern America. However, these globalization trends must be considered through the lens of U.S. professional baseball’s hierarchical labor structure, to better understand how labor globalization has reshaped the player labor force in both the Major and Minor Leagues. Given the number of data points represented in these visualizations (nearly 100,000), a significant degree of aggregation is needed to make sense of the large-scale data set. However, focusing on “slices” of the data illustrates how those larger globalization trends are inflected across classification levels and specific global regions.</p>
<p>At the aggregate level, Minor League players far outnumber Major League players, regardless of birth location. Drilling down into the specific classification levels, globalized labor practices reveal the ways in which players born outside Northern America are less likely to reach a Major League roster than their North American-born counterparts. Nearly all players who have played on Foreign Rookie League teams were born in Latin America and the Caribbean (see Figure 55). By comparison, of the players who have played on Rookie League teams, only 30% were born in Latin America and the Caribbean (see Figure 55). While most players on Foreign Rookie and Rookie League teams were born either in Latin America and the Caribbean or Northern America, Figure 56 illustrates the other global regions represented in those classification levels. Players born in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania are present in the Foreign Rookie and Rookie League levels, and their numbers have also increased over the last twenty years. However, Figure 56’s scale compared to the number of players represented in Figure 55 indicates the relatively small number of players born in these other global regions. While present, players born in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania do not have the same level of representation as players born in Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America. Furthermore, the change over time in their degree of representation does not exhibit the same growth patterns observed for Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America (see Figure 55).</p>
<p>Figure 57 presents the number of players at the A+, A, and A- levels born in Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America. In the analysis of the Rookie and Foreign Rookie Leagues, the past twenty years of growth show the most dramatic increase for players born in Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast, the growth represented in Figure 57 shows an increasing number of players who play for an A level team were born in Northern America. The number of players born in Latin America and the Caribbean does increase during the same period, but it is still over shadowed by the number of players born in Northern America. Players born in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania are represented on A-level teams, and their numbers have increased over the past twenty years (see Figure 58).</p> 
<p>However, few distinct trends emerge in that visualization, which ultimately represents a limited number of players out of the larger A-level pool. Placing Figures 55 and 57 side-by-side reveals an intriguing trend. Players born in Latin America and the Caribbean appear with increasing frequency at the least-advanced Minor League levels (Foreign Rookie and Rookie). However, their increased presence is not reflected in the demographics of A-level players. While the number of players at the A level has grown significantly, that growth does not reflect the same type of transformation taking place at the Foreign Rookie and Rookie League levels. That discrepancy is significant because moving up the Minor League hierarchy is the primary way by which Minor League players are eventually able to join a Major League team. </p>
<p>Those discrepancies continue at more-advanced Minor League classification levels. Figure 59 outlines the number of players at the AA-level born in Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern America, and Figure 60 presents the same data for AAA-level players. Similar, if less dramatic, trends emerge. The overall number of AA and AAA players has increased notably over the last twenty years. However, that growth is most notable for players born in Northern America. At the Rookie and Foreign Rookie League levels, players born in Latin America and the Caribbean significantly outnumber their North American counterparts. But when looking at the composition of more-advanced Minor League team classifications, that proportion does not hold true. The number of Latin American and Caribbean players does increase at the A, AA, and AAA levels over the last twenty years. But the Foreign Rookie and Rookie League representation trends never reappear in more-advanced levels of the Minor League hierarchy. </p>
<p>Nearly 100% of the players who play for Foreign Rookie League teams are born outside Northern America. That number goes to 30% at the Rookie League level and 20% at the A level. At the AA and AAA levels, fewer than 20% of players are born outside Northern America. By comparison, only 15% of Major League players are born outside Northern America. As illustrated in Figure 61, despite the overall increase in the number of players born in Latin America and the Caribbean, the overwhelming majority of those players have only played on Minor League teams and have not experienced proportional increases at the Major League and advanced Minor League levels. In contrast, Figure 62 shows how the number of players born in Northern America has increased over time and maintained a significant presence at the Major League and advanced Minor League levels.</p>
<p>These numbers illustrate how the global scope of U.S. professional baseball labor is directly influenced by labor practices that concentrate players born outside Northern America in the least-advanced Minor League levels. Rather than create expanded global opportunities at the Major League level or at more-advanced Minor League levels, U.S. professional baseball has built the Minor League system to prey on global labor. To illustrate those changes over time, Figure 63 shows how the overall number of Minor League players has increased from 1960 to 2016. However, the visualization also makes clear how the majority of that growth has benefited players born in Northern America, followed by players born in Latin America and the Caribbean.  To look at those numbers another way, the greatest number of players born outside Northern America are found at the least-advanced Minor League levels. And as argued in the previous section of the dissertation, the longest and most stable careers in U.S. professional baseball are experienced only by players who advanced to the Major League level. Thus, the players born outside Northern America experience the least stable professional careers.</p>
<p>To illustrate that transformation via spatial visualization, Figures 64 and 65 present heatmaps of Major and Minor League player birthplaces for players who were active in the 1960 season. The heatmap presented in Figure 64 shows Major League players born largely within Northern America, with a few clusters throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The heatmap presented in Figure 65 shows a similar distribution, with most Minor League players birthplaces concentrated in Northern America. However, more dense clusters are visible in Latin America and the Caribbean, indicating that even in 1960 Minor League Baseball’s labor force had a global reach. In contrast, Figures 66 and 67 present heatmaps of Major and Minor League players birthplaces for players who were active in the 2016 season. Figure 66 shows how the densest concentration of Major League player birthplaces has shifted from the northeastern U.S. to the southwestern U.S. The less-dense clusters visible in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1960 map have become some of the densest clusters for player birthplaces. Similarly, Figure 67 shows how the concentration of Minor League player birthplaces has shifted to place the densest clusters in the southwestern U.S. as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Figure 67 illustrates the increasingly global Minor League baseball that has emerged since 1960. On one hand, the increasing number of players born in Latin America and the Caribbean is nominally reflected at the Major League level. However, this analysis more directly reinforces the small number of Major League and advanced Minor League opportunities available. Considered together, Figures 67 and 62 highlight the reality that the majority of these Major League and advanced Minor League opportunities are taken by players born in Northern America.</p> 

## Conclusion

<p>This section of the dissertation works to emphasize the “normal” within U.S. professional baseball labor. Rather than focusing on specific players, careers, seasons, or teams, the section’s analysis grapples with the large-scale implications of data that addresses those specific elements, clearly demonstrating the need to consider Minor League Baseball in discussions of U.S. professional baseball’s global presence and global labor pool. Doing so underscores a Minor League player development system that draws increasing numbers of players born outside Northern America but fails to provide significant opportunities for long-term career success and stability.</p>
<p>In addition to the precarity experienced by most Minor League players, those born outside Northern America face additional challenges, including language barriers, cultural or racial bias, and broader immigration debates that impact visa availability. As Elias argues, the global dimensions of U.S. professional baseball cannot be considered in isolation—U.S. geopolitics and foreign affairs are fundamentally intertwined with baseball labor’s global dimensions.<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> Scholars like Elias, Burgos, and Ruck detail the impact U.S. foreign affairs have had on U.S. professional baseball labor, outlining how baseball as a tool of U.S. imperialism is inextricably connected with U.S. professional baseball’s global reach to underscore the fundamental relationship between global markets and baseball labor.<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup></p>
<p>However, most of that scholarship focuses almost exclusively on Major League teams and players, overlooking ninety percent of U.S. professional baseball labor. Major League players experience workplace benefits and protections not available to most Minor League players. For Major League players, things like minimum salary levels, free agency, grievance procedures, and other aspects of working conditions can be negotiated via collective bargaining and union representation. As argued elsewhere in this dissertation, Minor League players do not have access to those same benefits and resources. Since increasing numbers of Minor League players are born outside Northern America, the precarious conditions experienced by most Minor League players are impacting an already vulnerable pool of laborers. </p>
<p>The analysis presented in this section reinforces two themes. First, that Minor League players comprise the overwhelming majority of U.S. professional baseball labor. Second, that only a fraction of U.S. professional baseball players ever makes it to the Major League level, and most players spend their entire U.S. professional careers in a work environment not covered by basic workplace protections like minimum wage laws or overtime regulations. The spatial analysis taken up in this section demonstrates how, in the second half of the twentieth century, the precarious labor conditions experienced by nearly all Minor League players increasingly impact players born outside Northern America. </p>
<p>While existing baseball scholarship has addressed the U.S. professional baseball’s increasingly global labor, most of that scholarship focuses on Major League players born outside Northern America, overlooking the significant number of global players who never play at the Major League level. Again, as Senne and Miranda argued in their class-action lawsuits, focusing only on the exceptional limits attention to the ordinary. That ordinary includes Minor League Baseball, which constitutes the majority of U.S. professional baseball’s teams and players. Ordinary also includes the significant number of players whose careers start and end in the Minor Leagues. This section’s analysis foregrounds Minor League Baseball as the primary site for globalized labor in U.S. professional baseball. While shifting labor dynamics, structures, and practices have certainly impacted and reshaped Major League Baseball, Minor League teams and players constitute 90% of U.S. professional baseball activities. </p>
<p>This section’s analysis provides a more complete view on the relationship between U.S. professional baseball labor and globalization, firmly centering Minor League Baseball dynamic global site. The scope of Minor League labor is fundamentally connected to the spatial dimensions of U.S. professional baseball’s labor practices. As increasing numbers of players born outside Northern America enter the Minor League player development system, disproportionately few of those players ever play at the Major League level. And the longest and most stable careers, and the workplace protections and benefits provided by a unionized workforce, are only available to players who gain a minimum amount of time on a Major League roster. Most U.S. professional baseball players never become eligible for those opportunities and benefits, and that group of players increasingly includes players born outside Northern America. These global players are recruited into a system via minimally-regulated labor practices, and once in that system have little agency or control over their labor conditions and career prospects. And, as outlined in the previous section, the MLBPA the purportedly advocates on behalf of U.S. professional baseball players has largely overlooked the needs of any Minor League players, much less international Minor League players. </p>
<p>The inequitable distribution of resources, power, and capital within U.S. professional baseball disadvantages and disenfranchises Minor League players. This section’s analysis illustrates how those power structures are increasingly experienced by Minor League players born outside Northern America. A lawsuit filed in 2000 by a group of former Minor League players from the Dominican Republic makes painfully clear the impact those inequitable labor structures and unregulated global labor practices can have. As underage youth in a Latin American academy, the plaintiffs were offered Minor League contracts, the next step toward a Major League career. The lawsuit alleged that a Major League team representative working at the academy “expressly conditioned their [the players’] continued employment and/or reassignment to U.S. teams on their submitting to his sexual advances and that he appropriated part of their earnings or signing bonuses for his personal use.”<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> The case was dismissed by U.S. courts due to lack of jurisdiction, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2001. While a singular example, the case illustrates the structures of power and systems of inducement that compel Minor League players to enter into and remain in a system that does not adequately compensate their labor and frequently minimizes or disregards their agency and autonomy. The case also illustrates how players born outside Northern America are especially vulnerable in that structure.</p>
<p>More broadly, this section of the dissertation examines the relationship of labor and globalization within U.S. professional baseball in the second half of the twentieth century, emphasizing Minor League Baseball’s centrality as a global labor site. The notion of U.S. professional baseball as any sort of “national pastime” makes claims about the sport’s cultural significance and labor practices that are not supported by a close examination player and team data. A romanticized view of U.S. professional baseball as any sort of national unifier that reflects democratic or meritocratic ideals overlooks the inequitable labor structures at work in the Minor League system. That characterization overlooks the degree to which globalized labor U.S. professional baseball’s player development system relies upon extractive colonial capitalist systems and in fact enables such labor practices to persist.</p>

In these visualizations a team is defined as a single entity that fielded a professional baseball team in a single season—the total number of teams are cumulative and include duplicate counts for teams that played multiple years. For example, Australia fielded two teams in both the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

The reader is forewarned that the Y axis scale in those stacked bar charts can vary within the same charts. This variance is necessary to make visible the comparative number of teams and players located outside Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean. Putting all those values on the same bar chart presents such a wide range that the smaller (under 500) values are not clearly visible. <a href="#ref83" title="Jump back to footnote 83 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
