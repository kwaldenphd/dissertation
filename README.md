# Dissertation

This is the repository for my dissertation, "Remapping and Visualizing Baseball Labor: A Digital Humanities Project." The repository includes the full text of the dissertation, visualizations, figures, and data excerpts. Due to licensing permisison restrictions, the full dataset and geospatial files that include the full dataset are not included in this repository.

Once deposited and archived, the dissertation will be available via ProQuest and [Iowa Research Online.](https://ir.uiowa.edu/) 

A public-facing interactive digital project is currently under development.
