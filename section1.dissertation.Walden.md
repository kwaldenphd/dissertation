# Road to the Show: A Labor History of Minor League Baseball

## Introduction

<p>This section of the dissertation begins by presenting a labor history of Minor League Baseball, focusing on how the labor structures and conditions governing the Minor Leagues have developed and evolved over time. At surface level, this history can seem like a dizzying array of acronyms, leagues, and associations. The rationale for presenting this history is two-fold.  First, understanding the contemporary state of the Minor Leagues requires some knowledge of the historical forces and developments that have led to the current structure. Second, Minor League Baseball’s labor structures and current system were not inevitable—they are the product of lobbying efforts, legal rulings, and often clamorous labor negotiations and compromises.</p>
<p>This labor history’s chronology has a few key anchor or reference points. What we now call Minor League Baseball began in 1901 as the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL). The 1903 National Agreement was the first attempt to formalize Major and Minor League Baseball’s relationship. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 1922 ruling in *Federal Baseball Club v. National League* gave Major League Baseball a legally-sanctioned antitrust exemption to operate as a monopoly. That legal precedent remains largely unchallenged.  Major League Baseball’s industry monopoly and control over player labor came to a head in debates around the reserve clause, which restricted players from negotiating on the free market. Catalyzed by labor organizer Marvin Miller, player labor organizing efforts that had previously only existed in fits and starts became the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). As the first certified baseball union, the MLBPA managed to gather a critical mass of players to support the fight for free agency. Punctuated by strikes, work stoppages, and federal mediation, the MLBPA succeeded in gaining limited access to free agency, which allowed Major League players to negotiate on the free market under specific conditions.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the MLBPA fought for free agency and other labor protections for Major League players. Those labor organizing efforts drastically reshaped the labor structures and practices at work in Major League Baseball, and consequently also had significant impact on Minor League labor. While the MLBPA’s work in the 1960s and 1970s significantly reshaped working conditions for Major League players, no equivalent measure has ever been taken for Minor League players, who have minimal protections and representation in the current labor system. As the dust settled on thirty years of labor strife, Minor League Baseball increased the size, scale, and scope of its operations in the 1990s and early 2000s, establishing Foreign Rookie Leagues outside the United States and creating additional Minor League classification levels. These measures increased the distance between entry-level Minor League teams and Major League rosters. In response to an increasingly inequitable labor structure, former Minor League players have unsuccessfully filed multiple class-action lawsuits to address Minor League labor’s vulnerable state. Those efforts have increased attention to Minor League working conditions. But, they also prompted Minor League Baseball’s executive office to mount a lobbying campaign for pro-business legislation that would cut off Minor League players’ access to potential legal remedies.</p>
<p>Minor League labor has always involved a significant degree of precarity. In this section of the dissertation, I address that precarity via three central themes—the history that has shaped Minor League labor structures, the Minor League labor’s scope and significance, and the labor activism that has been largely unsuccessful in advocating for Minor League players. I do so by outlining a history of the structures and organizations that evolved into current-day Major and Minor League Baseball. Then, I address the human scale of those structures in terms of the number of Minor League players and teams. Then, I present a history of player labor activism, focusing on the MLBPA’s inattention to Minor League working conditions. Finally, I conclude by discussing more recent efforts to reshape Minor League labor conditions.</p>

### History

#### The Minor League’s Emergence

<p>n U.S. professional baseball’s early days, organizations like the National Association (1871-1875) attempted to give the emerging national game some degree of structure. However, that early history reveals an institution whose structure and labor conventions were in flux, as evidenced by short-lived teams, leagues, and associations. The National League (founded in 1876) evolved into today’s Major League Baseball. However, early Major League prototypes like the National League were not only professional baseball operations happening in the U.S. The Northwestern League (founded in 1883) was one of the earliest documented examples of a “minor league,” a formalized, professional baseball league that—while not part of the dominant National League—held professional status. However, many of these early “minor leagues” were short-lived. The Northwestern League operated for a single season, and the Western League (another minor league) lasted only four seasons. The Western League was renamed the American League and assumed equal status with the National League in 1901. Together, the National League and American League constitute Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Faced with rapidly-shifting league structures and many short-lived league experiments, minor league team executives formed the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL) in 1901. The NAPBL is now known as Minor League Baseball. As originally conceived, the NAPBL was a loose association of minor leagues that grew from 14 leagues and 96 clubs in 1902 (its first active season) to 35 leagues and 246 clubs by 1909. Faced with the growing power of organized NAPBL owners, Major League Baseball responded by drafting the 1903 National Agreement, a document that provided some level of formal affiliation between Major League and Minor League Baseball. The National Agreement ensured no NAPBL team would be required to sell players to a higher-level team and required NAPBL teams to be compensated for players lost to higher-level teams. In theory, under the terms of the Agreement, Minor League teams would not be forced to give up their players to a Major League team. And Minor League teams who did lose players to a Major League team would be compensated for players lost.</p>
<p>Initially, the 1903 National Agreement gave Minor League Baseball a degree of autonomy, although Minor League teams were informally understood as a step below Major League teams. However, the 1922 *Federal Baseball Club v. National League* U.S. Supreme Court decision changed that relationship. The verdict provided a foundation and legal precedent for Major League Baseball’s long-standing antitrust exemption. In doing so, it also paved the way for Major and Minor League Baseball’s hierarchical relationship.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>  The case’s plaintiff was the Federal Baseball Club, a member of the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Players. The Federal League was a professional baseball organization that did not abide by the 1903 National Agreement. Even before self-declaring major league status for the 1914 season, it was considered an outlaw league, meaning the league was not recognized by Major League Baseball and the parties covered in the 1903 National Agreement.</p>
<p>Seeing the national game’s rising cultural significance and economic stakes, Federal League executives wanted to challenge Major League Baseball’s monopoly on U.S. professional baseball. They did so by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the American and National Leagues (which together formed Major League Baseball). Though filed in 1915, the suit languished in district court. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court in 1922, most Federal League teams had been bought out by other Major League owners or had folded due to financial hardship.</p>
<p>In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled that professional baseball, because of its entertainment and leisure functions, did not constitute a form of interstate commerce. Therefore, professional baseball was not subject to the terms of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Another antitrust challenge came in 1953, by way of a lawsuit about Major League Baseball’s reserve clause.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> A component of all Major League contracts, the reserve clause gave the team that first signed a player full control over that player’s future contract terms. The reserve clause prevented players from negotiation a contract with other teams, giving them little strategic advantage when negotiating with their current team. In the 1953 lawsuit, Minor League pitcher George Toolson argued the reserve clause binding him to the New York Yankees constituted a restraint of trade and an antitrust violation.</p>
<p>While ultimately unsuccessful, Toolson’s lawsuit did not yield a unanimous verdict. Majority opinion authors saw Congressional lawmakers as the ones able to change Major League Baseball’s legal status, arguing “Congress has had the ruling under consideration, but has not seen fit to bring such business under these laws by legislation having prospective effect. The business has thus been left for thirty years to develop on the understanding that it was not subject to existing antitrust legislation ... [I]f there are evils in this field which now warrant application to it of the antitrust laws, it should be by legislation.”<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> The two dissenting justices (Harold Burton and Stanley Reed) offered a different perspective and argued “organized baseball's well known and widely distributed capital investments” were reasons to reconsider the antitrust exemption.<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> According to Burton and Reed, U.S. professional baseball’s “highly organized ‘farm system’ of minor league baseball clubs, coupled with restrictive contracts and understandings between individuals and among clubs or leagues playing for profit throughout the United States, and even in Canada, Mexico, and Cuba” made upholding baseball’s antitrust exemption by refusing to label it interstate commerce “a contradiction in terms.”<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Toolson’s case illustrates Major and Minor League Baseball’s hierarchical relationship that developed following the 1922 *Federal Baseball* verdict. Granted an antitrust exemption and a legally-sanctioned monopoly, Major League owners were able to reframe the terms of the 1903 National Agreement and by extension their relationship with Minor League owners. No longer were Minor League teams a threat to Major League Baseball’s monopoly status. Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption stripped Minor League owners of any ability to compete with Major League teams on the free market. Who would be allowed to participate in U.S. professional baseball and reap the economic benefits would be decided by Major League owners, not the free market.</p>
<p>This shift directly impacted the still-developing Minor League system. For example, the Pacific Coast League was an independent professional league founded in 1903. As Major League Baseball expanded into western states during the 1950s, the Pacific Coast League went from an independent professional league to group of Minor League teams affiliated with Major League Baseball. The American Association of Professional Baseball shared a similar fate. Founded in 1902 as a collection of Minor League teams, the organization started to collapse in the 1950s, their profits eroded by Major League teams’ expanding into western markets.<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>  The 1922 Federal Baseball ruling barred Minor League teams from making a bid to become major league alternatives. The 1903 Agreement that afforded Minor League teams a significant degree of autonomy also meant they had no formal relationship or affiliation with Major League teams. Thus, Minor League owners had little capacity or autonomy to justify or sustain their own existence when Major League owners’ priorities shifted. Since U.S. professional baseball’s organizational structures shifted frequently in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, Minor League teams often lacked firm financial standing.</p>

#### Growing the Farm System

<p>In the 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals executive Branch Rickey devised a new approach to managing Minor League teams and Minor League players. After taking the helm at St. Louis, Rickey invested in seven Minor League teams that were administered by the St. Louis Major League team. Those original 7 Minor League teams became the foundation of an extensive system that by the 1930s included over 30 Minor League teams. Under the 1903 National Agreement, Minor League teams had to be compensated for players lost to Major League teams. Rickey’s system kept those transactions “in house,” by only working with Minor League teams affiliated with and administered by St. Louis’s Major League team. The success of St. Louis’s home-grown talent caught the attention of other Major League teams, even as the system threatened the balance of power between Major and Minor League owners.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the 1903 National Agreement, Minor League teams were somewhat independent and autonomous, especially in terms of managing player contracts. For a Major League team to employ a player currently under contract with a Minor League team, the National Agreement established procedures and compensation guarantees that protected the Minor League team. In Rickey’s “farm system” model, Minor League teams were institutionally affiliated with and controlled by a Major League franchise. The “farm system” model framed Minor League teams as a cost-effective means by which Major League teams could sign a player to a contract early in his career and, because of the reserve clause, keep that player under contract for the remainder of his career. Rickey’s innovations to the Minor League system threatened to upend established conventions for Major and Minor League relations. Major League owners already held significant power and advantage, and Rickey’s system exacerbated that dynamic. In the existing system, Major League owners had to negotiate or deal with Minor League owners on U.S. professional baseball’s version of the free market. In Rickey’s model, Major League teams subsidized select Minor League teams, which then became overt talent pipelines for the Major League team.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball’s Commissioner, Kennesaw Landis repeatedly attempted to curb the growth of Rickey’s Minor League system by releasing Minor League players from their affiliation contracts and fining Major League owners that developed formal affiliation agreements with Minor League teams.<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>  However, the Commissioner was appointed by Major League owners and served at their behest. And Major League owners stood to benefit greatly from adopting Rickey’s approach to Minor League player development. By the time Rickey left the Cardinals 1942, most Major League teams were actively developing Minor League systems in Rickey’s model, with Minor League teams affiliated with and subsidized by specific Major League teams. For Minor League players, this arrangement was initially promising, with benefits like working with coaches already familiar with the Major League team’s priorities and playing style. An affiliated Minor League system may have initially suggested a faster timeline to the Major Leagues and more Major League opportunities for players. However, the opposite actually occurred.</p>
<p>Minor League baseball’s classification system was also a structure that emerged out of Rickey’s farm system model. As Rickey’s model became increasingly widespread, Major League team owners developed a classification system for identifying and organizing “levels” of teams in their Minor League system. Since Minor League teams were moving toward strictly operating as player development pipelines, these classifications created a structure in which novice players would advance through more advanced levels of play before joining the Major League team. Up until 1963, Minor League teams used the following classification system:</p>
<ul><li>AAA <i>(most advanced)</i></li>
  <li>AA</li>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>D</li>
  <li>D- <i>(least advanced)</i></li></ul>
<div align="left"><p>A 1963 reorganization resulted in the following classification system:</p>
  <ul><li>AAA <i>(most advanced)</i></li>
  <li>AA</li>
  <li>A</li>
    <li>Rookie <i>(least advanced)</i></li></ul>
<div align="left"><p>The 1963 reorganization drastically reduced the number of Minor League teams, and thus also limited the overall number of Minor League players. However, that limited Minor League structure did not remain in place for long. Post-1963 changes added three classification levels, the advanced A class (A+), the short-season A class (A-), and the Foreign Rookie League class.  While the Minor League system has never again reached the sprawling proportions of Branch Rickey’s 1930’s-era player development system, reorganization efforts have largely failed to curb the overall number of Minor League classification levels. As of the 2018 season, Minor League Baseball uses the following classification system:</p>
  <ul><li>AAA <i>(most advanced)</i></li>
  <li>AA</li>
  <li>A+</li>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>A-</li>
  <li>Rookie</li>
    <li>Foreign Rookie <i>(least advanced)</i></li></ul>
<div align="left"><p>That hierarchy is also represented in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 12.</a></p> 
<p>In the current system, each Major League team has a roster of players and related coaching personnel. Major League teams execute Player Development Contracts with specific Minor League teams each year. Those Contracts formalize the relationship between a Major and Minor League team and have become a standard component of Major League Baseball’s official rules.<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 12</a> illustrates the 2015 Minor League affiliation structure for five Major League teams. In the 2016 season, more than 7,000 players on 244 teams were part of the Minor League system. Only 868 players appeared on rosters for Major League teams, constituting less than 10% of U.S. professional baseball’s entire labor force <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 13-15)</a>. As <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 16</a> illustrates, the overall number of players has gradually increased over time. However, <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 17</a> illustrates how that increase in players has occurred largely at the Minor League level.</p>
<p>In the 1960 season, 3,986 players were spread across 16 Major and 157 Minor League teams. In the 2016 professional baseball season, 8,656 players played for 30 Major and 233 Minor League teams. Part of the Minor League team and player increase came from growth at the Major League level. From the 1950s through the 1990s, Major League Baseball grew from 16 to 30 teams. This growth increased the overall number of Minor League teams, as each new Major League team created its own Minor League affiliate system. The number of players under contract in a given affiliation system also increased during this period. While the expanding number of Major League teams did create additional opportunities at the Major League level, each new Major League team also came with multiple Minor League teams necessary to support the affiliated Minor League structure. The sheer number of Minor League teams drastically increased the number of Minor League players.</p> 
<p>In 1960, the 5 least-advanced Minor League classifications (D-, D, C, B, A) accounted for 62% of the total number of Minor League teams. That percentage has increased slightly. In 2016, the 5 least-advanced Minor League classifications (Foreign Rookie, Rookie, A-, A, A+) constituted 67% of the total number of Minor League teams. Because the number of less-advanced Minor League teams has increased, the number of players playing for less-advanced teams has also grown. Figure 13 compares the number of players who played U.S. professional baseball in the 1960 season (3,762) to the number of players who played U.S. professional baseball in the 2016 season (7,762), showing a 106% increase in the number of players.</p>
<p>However, that increase has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in Major League opportunities. As illustrated in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 15</a>, Minor League players greatly outnumber Major League players, in 1960 and 2016. The number of Major League players has increased during this period (from 575 in 1960 to 1,353 in 2016), as has the number of Minor League players (from 3,402 in 1960 to 7,302 in 2016). But represented as a proportion, Minor League labor in a given season represents anywhere from 90-95% of all U.S. professional baseball labor <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 14-15)</a>.<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> While the number of U.S. professional teams has increased (see Figure 18), <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figures 19 and 20</a> illustrate how most of that increase has taken place in the Minor League system.</p>
<p>In the 1960 season, 142 Major and Minor League teams were part of the U.S. professional baseball ecosystem, which grew to 228 teams by the 2016 season <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figure 18</a>. Represented as a proportion, Major League teams accounted for 11% of the total number of U.S. professional teams in 1960, and 13% in the 2016 season <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 18 and 19)</a>.  Minor League teams accounted for 88.7% of U.S. professional teams in 1960 and 86.8% of professional teams in 2016 <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 18 and 19)</a>. On the surface, the increasing number of Major League teams might appear to be a promising development for Minor League players. However, calculating those proportions in terms of the number of players, rather than the number of teams, indicates how the increasing number of Major League teams has not positively impacted the ratio of Major to Minor League players.</p> 
<p>As illustrated in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 21</a>, the average number of teams per Major League franchise has gradually increased over time, from approximately 6 teams per franchise in the early 1960s to 7.6 teams per franchise in the 2016 season.<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>  However, <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 22</a> illustrates how the number of Major League teams per franchise has remain constant at one. Meanwhile, the number of Minor League teams per franchise has increased from approximately 4 Minor League teams per franchise in the mid-1970s to 6.6 Minor League teams per franchise in 2016. Framing that change in terms of number of players illustrates that change’s human scale <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 13-15)</a>.</p>
<p>The disproportionate number of Minor League players would be less concerning if Minor League players’ working conditions and career stability were comparable to their Major League counterparts. However, the longest and most stable careers are experienced only by individuals who make it to the Major League level, a small fraction of the overall labor pool. Those trends persist, whether looking at overall number of players, number of players broken down by classification, or number of players broken down over time. Overall, players spend an average of 5.67 seasons in the Major Leagues and an average of 3.96 in the Minor Leagues (see Figure 23), indicating Major League players experience the longest careers. Of the 52,397 players who have played U.S. professional baseball since 1960, approximately 48,000 of those players never appeared on a Major League roster.</p> 
<p>As <a href=https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 23</a> illustrates, approximately 10,000 players have spent 1-2 seasons in the Minor Leagues, while fewer than 2,000 players have spent 1-2 seasons on a Major League roster. Overall, the number of players who ever play in the Major Leagues is significantly lower than the number that play in the Minor Leagues, despite the fact the longest careers are experienced by Major League players. Figure 24 emphasizes that trend, showing how the largest numbers of players are have only brief careers on Minor League teams. By comparison, <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 24</a> also highlights the limited number of players who reach the Major Leagues, as well as their higher number of average seasons played. Looking at the large number of Minor League players and their precarious career trajectories, one might assume that the earliest and most successful efforts at player-driven labor activism focused on Minor League issues. However, the labor activism that has been successful in U.S. professional baseball has largely focused on improving working conditions for Major League players.</p>
  
## Player Activism

### Introduction

<p>Dominant narratives about successful labor activism in U.S. professional baseball tend to focus on landmark labor victories secured by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). However, the MLBPA is the product of a long history of player labor activism. While the MLBPA has certainly effected positive change in players’ working conditions, this section of the dissertation argues its efforts have failed to address Minor League players’ material concerns and labor priorities. Despite the significant labor victories achieved for Major League players by the MLBPA, unaddressed inequities in the Minor League labor system persist. The lack of movement on labor issues related to Minor League players is exacerbated by Minor League players’ limited ability to advocate for their own interests within current U.S. professional baseball labor structures.</p>
  
### History

<p>Through the middle of the twentieth century, Major and Minor League owners were afforded a significant degree of power and autonomy. With Major League owners protected by a legally-sanctioned antitrust exemption, players who wanted to play professionally had few, if any, alternatives. For many fans, the rhetoric of “play” and “pastime” used to describe baseball were in tension with attempts to frame professional baseball as a business that should be governed by the labor regulations implemented in other industries. Thus, for most of the twentieth century, U.S. professional baseball players had little ability to successfully negotiate aspects of their labor conditions.</p> 
<p>As part of the New Deal’s economic stimulus measures, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) established the forty-hour work week, overtime protections, and the federal minimum wage. The FLSA might have given U.S. professional baseball players some legal grounds to argue for increased labor protections, had it not included a few narrow exceptions. Specifically, the law would not apply to “any employee employed by an establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment” or any industry that “does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year.”<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>  The U.S. professional baseball season runs from Opening Day in March to the end of the regular season in September—just under the seven-month minimum required for FLSA eligibility.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup></p> 
<p>Adding to the precarity of players’ labor conditions, starting in 1879, U.S. professional baseball contracts included a version of the reserve clause. The reserve clause evolved from an informal practice of reserving players for a season to a contractual measure that the team to first sign a player control over that player’s contract for the remainder of their career. Until the 1970s, players were granted single-year contracts. Players accepted the contract offered by their current team or faced the alternative of not playing U.S. professional baseball. Confronted with precarious labor conditions and limited alternatives, players attempted a variety of measures to renegotiate U.S. professional baseball’s labor practices via collective action. However, until the MLBPA was certified as a union in the 1960s, most of these organizing efforts were short-lived and unsuccessful.</p> 
<p>Founded in 1885, the Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players was able to secure a meeting with National League owners. However, the Brotherhood’s support quickly dwindled when it failed to force any substantive concessions from owners. The Brotherhood was followed by the Players League (founded in 1890), a player-run organization that folded after one season. Founded in 1900, the Players’ Protective Association targeted issues related to the reserve clause and collusion but collapsed after the 1903 National Agreement went into effect. The Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America (founded in 1912) and the National Baseball Players Association of the United States (founded in 1922) were the last significant labor organizing efforts before World War II. Their brief tenures and failure to extract concessions kept baseball’s labor power concentrated with owners until the post-War period.</p>
<p>Player labor activism (and U.S. professional baseball more broadly) dwindled during World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. Founded in 1946, the American Baseball Guild benefited from a shifting U.S. economic landscape and post-War economic boom that continued through the 1950s. Additionally, the Great Depression’s workplace regulations and labor protections were becoming increasingly standard, expected parts of the U.S. workplace. The Guild had some limited success raising minimum salaries for Major League players but disbanded after it was unable to gain traction with players and owners on more substantive labor issues.</p> 
<p>Founded in 1956, the Major League Baseball Players’ Association (MLBPA) started as an informal player-led organization. However, organized labor specialist Marvin Miller took the helm in 1966 and had the organization certified as a union the same year. As Mitchell Nathanson argues, Miller’s work with the MLBPA was part of a larger fundamental shift in how Major League Baseball players understood their earning potential, labor rights, and relationship to owners.<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>  The 1968 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the MLBPA was the first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in U.S. professional sports history. The 1968 CBA established minimum salaries for Major League players, and in successive CBAs, Major League players gained access to legal representation in salary negotiations (1973), higher minimum salaries (every CBA), and some level of control over contract assignments (1973).</p> 
<p>In these early CBAs, the reserve clause was one of the most significant areas of tension between players and owners, and the MLBPA was initially unable to significantly challenge the reserve clause during CBA negotiations. Major League player Curt Flood and the MLBPA unsuccessfully challenged the reserve clause, but the 1969 Supreme Court case increased public awareness and player engagement around the reserve clause and free agency. The MLBPA presented free agency as system that would roll back the reserve clause’s unilateral power over contract assignments. Free agency would establish limits on the number of seasons a team could control a player’s contract. Once a team had reached those limits (known as “service time”), the player became eligible for free agency and could negotiate with any team interested in offering them a contract. Major League Baseball repeatedly challenged the legality of free agency, refusing to recognize aspects of the CBA that included free agency until legal challenges were resolved. When the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled in favor of free agency in 1972, the MLBPA achieved a major labor victory, and free agency has been a part of every CBA since 1976.</p>

### Whose Player’s Union—Minor League Players and the MLBPA

<p>Dominant narratives around the MLBPA’s history celebrate the organization’s success in changing working conditions for Major League players. And undoubtedly, the MLBPA’s gains on issues like free agency, grievance procedures, and minimum salaries had a dramatic and immediate positive impact on Major League working conditions. In the face of lockouts, strikes, and work stoppages, the union succeeded where earlier organizing efforts had failed, significantly altering professional baseball’s labor power dynamics. However, the benefits and advantages procured via the MLBPA’s efforts are not equally available for all U.S. professional baseball players. Only players who have signed a Major League contract or have earned a minimum amount of Major League service time are eligible to join the MLBPA and benefit from the labor protections provided via the CBA.</p>
<p>However, every CBA since 1968 has included the following introductory language:</p>
<blockquote>“In making this Agreement, the Association represents that it contracts for and on behalf of the major league baseball players and individuals who may become major league baseball players during the term of this Agreement.”</blockquote>
<p>The only players eligible to join the MLBPA are those who have Major League contracts, and the privileges afforded by the MLBPA’s efforts most directly benefit Major League players. However, the MLBPA positions itself as acting on behalf of Major League players and “individuals who may become major league baseball players during the term of this Agreement”—a category that includes all Minor League players. As outlined previously in this section, Minor League players represent anywhere from 90-95% of the total baseball labor pool in any given season. The MLBPA purports to represent a class of workers who are not eligible for union membership, and that class represents the vast majority of U.S. professional baseball labor.</p>
<p>The sheer number of Minor League players and the degree to which they outnumber Major League players beg the question why labor activism efforts that largely benefit Major League players have not devoted similar or even comparable resources to Minor League issues. The MLBPA’s limited efforts on behalf of Minor League players also raises questions about the degree to which the organization adequately represents or includes Minor League perspectives. No active Minor League players are able to take part in the MLBPA’s operations, and the MLBPA has failed to advocate for the Minor League players it purportedly represents. Since it was established and run by Major League players, the MLBPA understandably spent its early years addressing issues of greatest concern to its Major League membership. However, as the MLBPA gained ground on significant issues like grievance procedures, salary protections, and free agency, the organization continued to act primarily in the interest of Major League players, failing to substantively pursue issues relevant to Minor League players. While the MLBPA has initiated conversation around increased regulation for Latin American academies and a formal recruitment process for international players, the union has not pressed on those issues, instead opting to gain ground in other areas like salary protections and medical injury-related care.</p>
<p>After the MLBPA became a certified union in 1966, Major League team owners and MLBPA representatives formed a body called the Player Relations Committee (PRC).  While the PRC bears the important task of negotiating the Collective Bargaining Agreements that govern baseball labor conditions, scholarship on baseball labor history rarely addresses the PRC. Analyzing the PRC’s history and composition offers further evidence of the MLBPA’s failure to address the material concerns of Minor League players and emphasizes the challenges Minor League players face in advocating for their own interests. Since its earliest iterations, the PRC has included player representatives, union officials, team owners, and Major League executives. Player representatives elected from the MLBPA membership constitute a significant portion of the PRC. The presence of these player representatives might suggest a range of player perspectives are brought to bear on CBA negotiations. However, becoming a player representative requires being an MLBPA member who is voted into that role by a peer group. To become a player representative on the PRC, a player must first have made it the Major Leagues and have sufficient name recognition and social capital with other Major League players to gain the necessary votes. Current Minor League players are ineligible, and players who have only recently joined the Major Leagues are at a disadvantage in terms of being competitive for a player representative spot.</p>
<p>Looking at the composition of player representatives compared to the larger pool of U.S. professional baseball players highlights the limited degree to which the PRC and by extension the MLBPA consider or advocate for Minor League players’ interests. Since the first CBA was negotiated in 1968, the PRC has included MLBPA executives, Major League players, Major League team executives, and members of Major League Baseball’s executive office. When CBA negotiations have resulted in forced mediation, NLRB arbitrators have also been part of the PRC’s operation. At no point in the PRC’s existence have currently-active Minor League players been part of its composition, despite the fact Minor League players represent roughly 90% of U.S. professional baseball labor. [See Figure 26.](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1)</p> 
<p>On average, player representatives’ Major League careers are significantly longer than the average Major League career enjoyed by the overall labor pool <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figures 24 and 25)</a>. The discrepancy in Major League career length is understandable given the notoriety players need to become a player representative. But, that discrepancy again highlights the PRC’s limited ability to represent or engage a truly diverse array of player experiences and priorities. The larger pool of players averages 5.6 seasons in the Major Leagues <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figure 24)</a>. By comparison, player representatives spend 11.3 seasons in the Major Leagues <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">(see Figure 25)</a>. Despite nearly all player representatives having some Minor League playing experience, their Major League career length far outpaces time spent in the Minor Leagues.</p>
<p>Including only Major League players in CBA negotiations means only a small subset of the larger labor pool has a voice in determining labor conditions. Additionally, the player representatives involved in negotiating the collective bargaining agreements have failed to reflect the increasing global diversity in U.S. professional baseball’s labor force. As will be discussed at length in the next section of the dissertation, U.S. professional baseball’s work force has become increasingly global in the decades following World War II. However, players representatives have only recently begun to reflect those global trends (see Figure 26 and the discussion of labor and globalization presented in the dissertation’s next section). And ultimately, the careers for players involved in CBA negotiations do not reflect the broader experience of U.S. professional baseball players, both in terms of their progression through the Minor Leagues and time spent playing for a Major League team. Those issues of equity and representation bear increasing weight given the overwhelming number of Minor League players and the degree of precarity they experience.</p>
  
## Conclusion

<p>As the MLBPA and Major League Baseball waged a series of labor battles, U.S. professional baseball was plagued by lockouts, strikes, and work stoppages, culminating in the 1994-1995 strike cancelled the 1994 World Series. To drive this point home, the MLBPA was certified as a union in 1966, and the first thirty years of the organization’s existence included the following events:</p>
  <ul><li>1972 strike</li>
    <li>1973 lockout</li>
    <li>1976 lockout</li>
    <li>1980 strike</li>
    <li>1981 strike</li>
    <li>1985 strike</li>
    <li>1990 lockout</li>
    <li>1994-1995 strike</li></ul>
<div align="left"><p>For three decades, strikes and work stoppages were the norm in U.S. professional baseball labor relations. Faced with an increasingly fractious national pastime, the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights held a series of Congressional hearings in 1995. As a referendum on the 1994-1995 strike, the hearings included testimony from Major League players, Major League executives, and MLBPA executives. Much of the hearings related to H.R.397, the Major League Play Ball Act which presented binding arbitration as a solution to ensure the 1995 MLB season would be played. From the text of the Play Ball Act:</p>
<blockquote>“It is the purpose of this Act to encourage serious negotiations between the major league baseball players and the owners of major league baseball, to prevent the continued economic loss to individuals not involved in the negotiations whose livelihood depends on baseball being played, to prevent ongoing losses to those communities that host major league baseball, to preserve major and minor league baseball, and to resolve the dispute between the players and owners.”<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></blockquote> 
<p>The hearings also asked Major League players, executives, and MLBPA representatives to account for U.S. professional baseball’s decades of labor turmoil.<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup>  As Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana) noted in his opening remarks, the sheer number of work stoppages in the MLBPA’s early decades would seem to indicate U.S. professional baseball’s existing labor structure was not functioning well, if at all. However, rather than pointing to U.S. professional baseball’s unusual monopoly status or underlying labor structures, Williams referenced his “duty” as a baseball fan to hold Major League Baseball accountable for the lost revenue, economic impact, and fan disappointment that resulted from strikes and lockouts.</p>
<p>H.R.397 never made it out of committee, but the hearings emphasized the lasting power of Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption, evidenced by Major League Baseball’s unchallenged ability to operate as an unregulated monopoly. Rather than question the core labor structures impacting U.S. professional baseball, Congressional involvement only reinforced those structures. While any potential legislation that emerged from the hearings would have a direct impact on Minor League Baseball, no Minor League representatives—players, owners, or executives—were called to testify.</p> 
<p>The 1994 strike ended when the U.S. District Court in New York ruled in favor of the MLBPA, forcing both parties back into active negotiations. As in the Congressional subcommittee hearings, Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s ruling directly mentioned baseball’s heightened cultural significance and the negative impact baseball work outages had on the American public.<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>  The heightened political tension around the 1994-1995 strike culminated in the introduction of 112 STAT. 2826, known as the Curt Flood Antitrust Act of 1997. Enacted in 1998, the bill also took steps to clarify the limitations hard-won free agency placed on placed on that exemption. The final legislation directly stated that “the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, its member leagues and the clubs of those leagues, are not ‘in the business of organized professional major league baseball.’”<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>  While the Curt Flood Act directly impacted Minor League Baseball, no Minor League players or representatives were called to testify during the twenty-one months the bill was introduced, discussed, revised, and approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate.</p>
<p>By including this clarification, Congress ensured the labor protections won by the MLBPA would not (and at least according to current legal precedent could not) be extended to Minor League players. The 1998 legislation upheld system that Major League organizations free rein and full autonomy in regulating the Minor League system. The 1998 Curt Flood Act managed to simultaneously preserve free agency for Major League players, reinscribe Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption, and prevent Minor League players from accessing the labor rights and protections the MLBPA had won for Major League players.</p>
<p>Any consideration of Minor League labor conditions was largely absent in the national conversation that followed the 1994-1995 strike and 1998 Curt Flood Act. However, the disenfranchisement of Minor League players became an object of discussion in 2014 and 2015. Multiple groups of former Minor League players filed class-action lawsuits against Major League Baseball, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Those lawsuits challenged the legal precedent used to exempt U.S. professional baseball from the Fair Labor Standards Act’s workplace protections. Those protections are largely only relevant for Minor League players, given their lack regulated minimum salary levels. Multiple appellate courts ruled that it would be impossible to certify Minor League players as a class because U.S. professional baseball constitutes a form of interstate commerce. As a point of reference, Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption is predicated on the argument that U.S. professional baseball does not constitute a form of interstate commerce. While ultimately unsuccessful, the lawsuits garnered attention from sport and mainstream media venues.<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup></p>
<p>The lawsuits also ignited pointed responses from Major and Minor League Baseball’s executive offices. Minor League Baseball’s executive office established a political action committee, which succeeded in getting H.R.5580, the Save America’s Pastime Act, introduced in 2015.<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>  While purportedly unrelated to the unsuccessful class-action lawsuits, H.R.5580 sought to amend the FLSA to “exempt from minimum wage and maximum hours requirements any employee who has contracted to pay baseball at the minor league level” and ensure “no employer shall be subject to liability or punishment on account of any violations of minimum wage, maximum hours, or specified recordkeeping requirements regarding any work performed before, on, or after enactment of this bill.”<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> As a point of reference, the class-action lawsuits were based on the FLSA’s minimum wage and maximum hour provisions. Immediate negative responses to the bill’s introduction made it a non-starter in terms of getting out of committee.  Although the initial attempt at the Save America’s Pastime Act was unsuccessful, continued lobbying by Minor League Baseball’s political action committee succeeded. A nearly-identical version of the 2015 Save America’s Pastime Act was added to the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R.1625, 115th Congress 201), which was signed into law on March 23, 2018.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>Any discussion of Minor League labor conditions must also grapple with the material impact those structures have on Minor League laborers—the thousands of players who are contractually obligated to participate in the U.S. professional baseball system realize the goal of becoming a Major League player. Major League salaries are typically in the public record, reported by mainstream media and archived in sites like Baseball Reference. However, reliable information about Minor League salaries is much less readily available. Minimum Minor League salaries are not outlined in Collective Bargaining Agreements, unlike minimum Major League salaries. Verified sport data sources like Major League Baseball, Sport Reference, or the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) do not include Minor League salary data, and the sources that do include it are not verified or are unclear about the scope and source of their information.<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup></p>
<p>As the legal filings in recent class-action cases *Senne v. MLB* and *Miranda v. Selig* argue, the visibility and focus on “successful” U.S. professional baseball players who reach the Major Leagues obscures larger issues of Minor League salary inequity and labor precarity.<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>  As illustrated in Figure 27, the advent of free agency in the 1970s dramatically increased both the average Major League salary and the minimum Major League salary. According to *Business Insider’s* analysis of Major League salary data, Major League salaries have risen 6,600% under free agency.<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>  As mentioned previously, minimum Minor League salary levels are not outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other governing documents. Without access to minimum wage protections or avenues for filing workplace grievances, Minor League players have few avenues to advocate for alternate compensation levels or a restructured payment system. The data in <a href="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/dissertation/tree/master/section1">Figure 28 and Table 2</a> provide one estimate for Minor League salary figures.</p> 
<p>Bringing together salary information I was able to find, the discrepancy between Major and Minor League salaries is stark. Only when players reach the AAA level after spending multiple years in the Minor Leagues do they approach something resembling a living wage. In the 19th and early-20th century, before the advent of the MLBPA, most Major League players relied on jobs outside baseball to supplement their baseball earnings. Contemporary Minor League players face similar financial strain and often need to secure additional income sources outside the playing season, while still complying with uncompensated, team-mandated obligations related to conditioning and nutrition. Those uncompensated obligations can also include participation in a fall or winter league, as well as spring training.</p> 
<p>This section of the dissertation highlights the variety of structures that shape Minor League labor conditions, bringing to the forefront a dimension of U.S. professional baseball labor often overlooked in dominant baseball narratives. Minor League Baseball’s labor history illustrates a system in which the interests of owners prevail over the rights of Minor League players, even as Major League players have achieved greater autonomy and agency via unionization and collective bargaining. While the MLBPA has largely failed to advocate effectively on behalf of Minor League players, Major League executives have formalized their control over Minor League labor conditions and limited Minor League players’ ability to advocate for changes in their working conditions.</p>
<p>Compounding that inequity, an increasing number of Minor League players enter the U.S. professional baseball system from outside the United States, raising larger questions about globalized labor and equity within U.S. professional baseball. As Gilbert argues, the power Major League players won via collective bargaining directly impacted the player development system, as “team owners responded by creating more flexible modes of control over the recruitment and development of future generations of athletes.”<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> This section of the focuses on the nuanced ways those “more flexible modes of control” developed and manifested, arguing that framing free agency as a “victory” for U.S. professional players ignores the impact (or lack of impact) the MLBPA’s activism had on Minor League players.</p> 
<p>Centering Minor League labor conditions emphasizes the disproportionate number of players under contract in a labor system that gives them little agency and few avenues for legal action. Despite growing awareness of Minor League labor conditions, no substantive measures have been introduced to change the Minor League system. The class-action lawsuits filed in 2014 and 2015 by former Minor League players may have increased public awareness, but the issues raised in those lawsuits were not part of the negotiations for the most recent CBA, which was signed in 2016 and went into effect in the 2017 season. Even as Minor League Baseball’s executive office mounted political lobbying efforts directly intended to disenfranchise 90% of U.S. professional baseball laborers, the MLBPA failed to address that attack in any of the public conversations or statements made around the 2016 CBA.</p>
<p>This section of the dissertation focuses on Minor League Baseball’s labor history and its scale, scope, and significance within the larger U.S. professional baseball ecosystem. The next section of the dissertation looks at how the growth of the Minor League system since the 1950s intersects with globalization. As Gilbert argues, the tactics and “new modes of control” Major League owners devised in response to free agency also involved “significantly expand[ing] their teams’ geographic reach, in search of top players and new fans.”<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> While existing baseball scholarship has looked at how those trends manifested at the Major League level, the next section of the dissertation takes up how globalization in U.S. professional baseball labor impacted Minor League Baseball. That history is partly about Minor League team locations and structures, but it also emphasizes a dramatic transformation in the composition of Minor League labor.</p>
